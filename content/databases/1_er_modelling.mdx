# Design Phases

- Initial phase: characterize fully the data needs of the prospective database users. Feedback from domain experts and users.
- Second phase: conceptual design
  - applying the concepts of the chosen data model
  - translating these requirements into a conceptual schema of the database
  - a fully developed conceptual schema indicates the _functional requirements_ of the enterprise
    - describe the operations that will be performed
- Final phase: Moving from an abstract data model to the implementation of the database
  - Logical design: deciding on the database schema. Database design requires that we find a "good" collection of relation schemas
    - Business decision - what attributes?
    - Computer science decision - what relation schemas should we have and how should the attributes be distributed among the various relation schemas?
  - Physical design - deciding physical layout

## Alternatives

- Two pitfalls
  - Redundancy: a bad design may result in repeat information, and data inconsistency
  - Incompleteness: a bad design may make somethings impossible to model

# Entity Relationship Model (E-R Model)

- Models an enterprise as a collection of _entities_ and _relationships_
  - Entity: a "thing" or "object" in the enterprise that is distinguishable from other objects
    - Described by a set of attributes
  - Relationship: an association among entities
- Represented diagrammatically by an _entity-relationship diagram_

## Database Modelling

The ER data model specifies an **enterprise schema** that represents the overall logical structure of a database.

The ER model employs three concepts:

- entity sets
- relationship sets
- attributes

Also has an associated diagram representation, **the ER diagram** which expresses the logical structure.

## Entity Sets

- An entity is an object, ex. specific person/company
- An entity set is a set of entities of the same type
- An entity is represented by a set of attributes
  - ex _instructor = (ID, name, salary)_
- A subset of the attributes form a _primary key_ of the dataset

## Relationship Sets

A relationship is an association among several entities. For example:

```
44553 (Peltier) -     *advisor*   -  22222 (Einstein)
student entity - relationship set -  instructor entity
```

A relationship set is a mathematical relation among $n \geq 2$ entities, each taken from entity sets.

An attribute can also be associated with a relationship set.

### Roles

Entity sets of a relationship need not be distinct, you can have a 'role' in the relationship

### Degree of a Relationship Set

- Binary relationship
  - involves two entities
  - most relationships in a DB are Binary
- more than two are rare, but do occur in certain scenarios

## Complex attributes

- **Simple** and **Composite**
  - Composite attributes can be divided into sub parts.
- **singe-valued** and **multivalued** (phone_numbers)
- **Derived** attributes
- **Domain** - the set of permitted values for each attribute

## Mapping Cardinality Constraints

- One to one
- One to many
- Many to one
- Many to many

In diagrams, arrow for one, and no arrow for many.

## Total and Partial Participation

Total participation is when every entity in the entity set participates in at least one relationship set.

Partial participation is where some entities may not participate in the relationship set.
