# SQL Parts

- SQL DDL: defining, deleting and modifying relation schemas
- SQL DML: query information from, insert tuples into, delete tuples from and modify tuples in the database
- integrity: SQL DDL includes commands for specifying integrity constraints
- View definition: SQL DDL includes commands for defining views
- Transaction control: SQL commands for specifying the beginning and ending of transactions
- Embedded SQL and dynamic SQL: define how SQL statements can be embedded within general-purpose programming languages
- Authorization: SQL DDL includes commands for specifying access rights to relations and views

# Data Definition Language

The SQL data-definition language (DDL) allows the specification of relations and information about relations, including:

- the schema for each relation
- the type of values associated with each attribute
- the integrity constraints
- the set of indices to be maintained for each relation
- security and authorization information for each relation
- the physical storage structure of each relation on disk

# Views

A view is defined as:

```SQL
create view v as < query expression >
```

Once a view is defined, the view name can be used to refer to the virtual relation that the view generates. This is not the same as creating a new relation by evaluating the query expression.

You can use views in the expression defining another view.

Certain database systems allow view relations to be physically stored. A physical copy is created when the view is defined.

# Transactions

A **transaction** consists of a sequence of query and/or update statements and is a "unit" of work. The SQL standard specifies that a transaction begins implicitly when an SQL statement is executed.

- the transaction must end with one of the following statements:
  - **Commit work**: the updates performed by the transaction become permanent in the database
  - **Rollback work**: All the updates performed by the SQL statements in the transaction are undone.
- Atomic transaction (indivisible)
  - either fully executed or rolled back as if never occurred
- Isolation from concurrent transactions
