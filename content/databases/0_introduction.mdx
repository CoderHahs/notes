# Basic Notions

- **Data**: known facts that have a meaning and that can be stored.
- **Database (DB)**: collection of interrelated data.
- Universe: part of real world about which the data stored in the DB relates to.
- **Database Management System (DMBS)**: software that allows to create and manipulate a database.
- **Database System**: collection of interrelated data and a set of programs that allow users to access and modify these data

# Purpose

Problems that occurred:

- data redundancy and inconsistency
- difficulty accessing data
- data isolation
- integrity Problems
- atomicity of updates
- concurrent access by multiple users
- security

Database systems offer solutions to all the above problems.

# Data Models

Data models provide a way to describe the design of a database at the physical, logical, and view levels (think schemas).

Categories:

- Relational model
- Entity-Relationship data model
- Object-based data models
- Semi-structured data model
- Network and Hierarchical model

## Relation Models

- all the data is stored in various tables (or relations)
- use primary keys (ids)

# Levels of abstraction

Database systems try to provide users with an abstract view of the data, the system hides certain details of how the data is stored and maintained.

## Physical Level

- describes how a record is stored

## Logical Level

- describes data stored in database, and the relationships among the data
- describes the entire database in terms of a small number of simple structures

## View Level

- application programs hide details of data types. Views also hide secure information

# Instances and Schemas

**Instances** - actual content of the database at a particular point in time. _Analogous to the value of a variable_

**Schema** - overall design of the database.

- **Logical Schema**: the overall logical structure of the database. _Analogous_ to type information of a variable in a program
- **Physical Schema**: the overall physical structure of the database.

# Data Independence

## Logical Data Independence

- protection from changes in the logical structure of data
- can modify the logical schema without changing the external schema or application programs
- addition or removal of certain relationships

## Physical Data Independence

- protection from changes in the physical structure of data
- can modify the physical schema without changing the logical schema
- possible changes:
  - using new storage device
  - using different data structures
  - changing the access method
  - using different file organization / changing indexes
- Applications depend o the logical schema
- In general, the interfaces between the various levels and components should be well defined so that changes in some parts do not seriously influence others

# Database Languages

A database system provides:

- a **data-definition language (DDL)** to specify the database schema
- a **data-manipulation language (DML)** to express database queries andupdates.

## Data-Manipulation Language (DML)

Two classes of language:

- **Pure**
  - used for proving properties about computational power
  - relational algebra
  - tuple relational calculus
  - domain relational calculus
- **Commercial**
  - SQL is the most widely used commercial language

There are two types of DMLs:

- **Procedural DML**
  - require a user to specify data needed and how to get it
- **Declarative DML**
  - require a user to specify what data are needed without specifying how to get it
  - easier to learn and use
  - a.k.a non-procedural DMLs
  - the portion of a DML that involves information retrieval is called a query language

### SQL Query Language

- non-procedural
- application programs generally access databases through one of:
  - language extensions to allow embedded SQL
  - application program interface (ODBC/JDBC) which allow SQL queries to be sent to a database
- SQL is not as powerful as a universal Turing machine
- SQL does not support actions such as input from users, output to displays or communication over the network

# Database Design

- **Logical design**: deciding on a database schema requires business and computer science inputs
- **Physical design**: deciding on the physical layout

# Database Engine

A database system is partitioned into modules that deal with each of the responsibilities of the overall system

contains:

- storage manager
- query processor
- transaction manager

## Storage Manager

- a program module that provides the interface between the low-level data stored in the database and the application programs and queries submitted to the system
- responsible for:
  - interaction with the OS file Manager
  - efficient store, retrieving and updating of data
- storage manager components include:
  - authorization and integrity manager
  - transaction manager
  - file manager
  - buffer manager

implements:

- **Data files** which store the database itself
- **Data dictionary** stores metadata about the structure of the database, in particular the schema of the database
- **Indices** provide fast access to data items

## Query Processor

- DDL interpreter: interprets DDL statements and records the definitions in the data dictionary
- DML compiler: translates DML statements in a query language into an evaluation plan consisting of low-level instructions that the query evaluation engine understands
- Query evaluation engine: executes low-level instructions generated by the DML compiler

### Procedure

1. Parsing and translation
2. Optimization
3. Evaluation

## Transaction Management

- a **transaction** is a collection of operations that performs a single logical function in a database application
- **Transaction-management** component ensures that the database remains in a consistent (correct) state despite system and transaction failures
- **Concurrency-control manager** controls the interaction among the concurrent transactions, to ensure the consistency of the database

# Database Architecture

- Centralized databases
  - one to a few cores, shared memory
- Client-server
  - one server machine executes work on behalf of multiple client machines
- Parallel databases
  - many core shared memory
  - shared disk
  - shared nothing
- Distributed databases
  - geographical distribution
  - schema/data heterogeneity

# Database Applications

- two-tier
  - the application resides at the client machine, where it invokes database system functionality at the server machine
- three-tier
  - the client machine acts as a front end and does not contain any direct database calls
  - client end communicates with an application server
  - application server in turn communicates with a database system to access data

# Database Users and Administrator

1. Native users: users who interact with the system by invoking one of the application programs that have been written previously
2. Application programmers: are computer professionals who write application programs
3. Sophisticated users: use a database query language or use tools such as data analysis software
4. Specialized users: write specialized database applications that do not fit into the traditional data-processing framework

Administrator has central control over the system and has functions:

- schema definition
- storage structure and access-method definition
- schema and physical-organization modification
- granting and authorization for data access
- routine maintenance
