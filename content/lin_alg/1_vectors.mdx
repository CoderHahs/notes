# Definition

A vector is an object that has both a magnitude and a direction. Geometrically, we can picture a vector as a directed line segment, whose length is the magnitude of the vector and with an arrow indicating the direction. A unit vector is a vector with magnitude 1 and any argument value.

# Dot Product
> $\overrightarrow{u} \bullet \overrightarrow{v} = u_1v_1+u_2v_2 + ... + u_nv_n = |\overrightarrow{u}||\overrightarrow{v}|cos\theta$

- dot product only works with two vectors

### Properties

If $\overrightarrow{u} \bullet \overrightarrow{v} =$
- $0$, $\overrightarrow{u} \perp \overrightarrow{v}$
- $< 0$, argument/angle is obtuse
- $> 0$, argument/angle is acute
- $1$, the two vectors are parallel
- $-1$, parallel and in opposite directions
