# Continuous Random Variables

Discrete data are data with a **finite** or **countably infinite** number of possible outcomes. 

Continuous data are data which come from a continuous interval of possible outcomes. It means that continuous data have *infinitely many outcomes*.

The *cumulative distribution function* remains the same for discrete and continuous random data.

# Probability Density Function (p.d.f)

The **probability density function** of a continuous random variable X is an **integrable** function $f_X: X(S) \to \R$
