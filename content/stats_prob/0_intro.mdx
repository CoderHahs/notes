# Sample Spaces

Any action with a random outcome is defined as **random experiment**

The **sample space** for this action is the set of all possible outcomes. Denoted as $S$.

A sample space can be **discrete** or **continuous**. Ex. flipping a coin, measuring weight $(0, \infty)$

For any events $A$ and $B$ in $S$:
- The union of $A \cup B$ are all outcomes from $S$ in either $A$ or $B$;
- The intersection of $A \cap B$ are all outcomes in both of $A$ and $B$;
- The complement of A(sometimes denoted as $\overline{A}$ or $-A$) is the set of all outcomes in $S$ that are not in $A$;

If $A$ and $B$ don't have any common outcomes, they are **mutually exclusive**. $A \cap B$ is the empty set.

# Counting Techniques

## Addition Rule

Consider a job that can be done with 2 independent machine; first machine OR second machine. The first machine does the job in $m_1$ ways and the second machine does the job in $m_2$ ways. Then, the job can be done in $m_1 + m_2$ ways.

## Multiplication Rule

A job that can be done in a **k-stage procedure** would be modeled as having $k$ bags, with $m_1$ items in the first bag,..., $m_k$ items in $k$-th bag. A $k$-stage process is a process for which:
- there are $m_1$ possibilities at stage 1;
- regardless of the 1st outcome there are $m_2$ possibilities of stage 2
- regardless of the previous outcomes, there are $m_k$ choices at stage $k$

Then there are $m_1\cdot m_2\cdot ...\cdot m_k$ total ways the process can turn out.

# Ordered and Unordered Samples

## Ordered Samples

Two different scenarios: **with replacement** or **without replacement**.

Sampling With Replacement (order important):

- If $n$ outcomes and $r$ repetitions then $n^r$

Sampling Without Replacement (order important):

- This results in $nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

## Unordered Samples

In this case we would use $nC_r = \frac{n!}{{(n-r)!r!}}$ = $n \choose r$
