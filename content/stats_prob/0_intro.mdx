# Sample Spaces

Any action with a random outcome is defined as **random experiment**

The **sample space** for this action is the set of all possible outcomes. Denoted as $S$.

A sample space can be **discrete** or **continuous**. Ex. flipping a coin, measuring weight $(0, \infty)$

For any events $A$ and $B$ in $S$:
- The union of $A \cup B$ are all outcomes from $S$ in either $A$ or $B$;
- The intersection of $A \cap B$ are all outcomes in both of $A$ and $B$;
- The complement of A(sometimes denoted as $\overline{A}$ or $-A$) is the set of all outcomes in $S$ that are not in $A$;

If $A$ and $B$ don't have any common outcomes, they are **mutually exclusive**. $A \cap B$ is $\varnothing$, or the empty set.

# Counting Techniques

## Addition Rule

Consider a job that can be done with 2 independent machine; first machine OR second machine. The first machine does the job in $m_1$ ways and the second machine does the job in $m_2$ ways. Then, the job can be done in $m_1 + m_2$ ways.

## Multiplication Rule

A job that can be done in a **k-stage procedure** would be modeled as having $k$ bags, with $m_1$ items in the first bag,..., $m_k$ items in $k$-th bag. A $k$-stage process is a process for which:
- there are $m_1$ possibilities at stage 1;
- regardless of the 1st outcome there are $m_2$ possibilities of stage 2
- regardless of the previous outcomes, there are $m_k$ choices at stage $k$

Then there are $m_1\cdot m_2\cdot ...\cdot m_k$ total ways the process can turn out.

# Ordered and Unordered Samples

## Ordered Samples

Two different scenarios: **with replacement** or **without replacement**.

Sampling With Replacement (order important):

- If $n$ outcomes and $r$ repetitions then $n^r$

Sampling Without Replacement (order important):

- This results in $nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

## Unordered Samples

In this case we would use $nC_r = \frac{n!}{{(n-r)!r!}}$ = $n \choose r$

# Probability of an Event

For situations where we have a random experiment which has exactly $N$ possible **mutually exclusive, equally likely outcomes, we can assign a probability to an event $A$ by counting the number of outcomes that correspond to $A$. If the count is $a$ then: $P(A) = \frac{a}{N}$.
> The probability of each individual outcome is thus $1/N$

# Axioms of Probability
1. For any event $A$, $1 \geq P(A) \geq 0$.
2. For the complete sample space $S$, $P(S) = 1$.
3. For the empty event $\varnothing, P(\varnothing) = 0$.
4. For two **mutually exclusive events** $A$ and $B$, the probability that $A$ or $B$ occurs is $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

Since $S = A \cup \overline{A}$, and since $A$ and $\overline{A}$ are mutually exclusive then, $1 = P(S) = P(A \cup \overline{A}) = P(A) + P(\overline{A}) \Rightarrow P(\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)$.

## General Addition Rule

> $(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cup B)

When $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, $P(A \cap B) = P(\varnothing) = 0$ and $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

If there are more than two events, the rule expands as follows:
> $P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) + P (A \cap B \cap C)$
