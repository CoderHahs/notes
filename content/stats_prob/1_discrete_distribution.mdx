# Random Variables and Distributions

Recall that. for any random "experiment", the set of all possible outcomes is denoted by $S$.

A **random variable** is a function $X: S \to \R$, i.e. it is a rule that associates a (real) number to every outcome of the experiment.

$S$ is the **domain** of the random variable $X;X(S) \subseteq R$ is its **range**.

A **probability distribution function** (p.d.f.) is a function $f : \R → \R$ which specifies the probabilities of the values in $X(S)$.

When $S$ is discrete, we say that $X$ is a $discrete r.v.$ and the p.d.f. is called a **probability mass function** (p.m.f.).

The p.m.f. of $X$ is $f(x) = P ({s ∈ S : X(s) = x}) := P(X = x)$.

The **cumulative distribution function** (c.d.f.) of $X$ is $F(x) = P(X ≤ x)$.

## Expectation of a Discrete Random Variable

The **expectation** of a discrete random variable $X$ is defined as:  
> $E|X| = \sum x\cdot P (X=x) = \sum xf(x)$.

This can be thought of as the sum of $x$ multiplied by the probability of $x$.

### Mean and Variance

The expectation can be interpreted as the average or the **mean** of $X$, denoted as $\mu$.

$E[(Z-E[Z])^2]$ can be thought of the distance from the mean or the **variance** denoted as $\mathrm{Var}[X]$.

> $\mathrm{Var}[X] = E[(X-\mu x)^2] = E[X^2]-\mu^2_x = E[X^2] - E^2[X] = \sigma^2_x$ 

### Standard Deviation

> $\mathrm{SD}[X] = \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[X]} = \sigma_x$

The mean gives some idea as to where the bulk of the distribution is, whereas the variance and standard deviation provide information about the **spread**; distributions with higher variance/SD are more **spread about the average**.
