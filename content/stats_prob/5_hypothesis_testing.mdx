# Claims and Suspicions

The "claim" is called the **null hypothesis** and denoted $H_0$.

The "suspicion" is called **alternative hypothesis** and denoted $H_1$ or $H_A$.

The (random) quantity we use to measure evidence is called a *test statistic*. We need to know its sampling distribution when $H_0$ is true. 

The *$p$-value* quantifies "the evidence against $H_0$". A smaller $p$-value means more evidence against claim.

## How small does the p-value need to be?

- $p$-value $\leq \alpha$ then we reject $H_0$
- $p$-value $> \alpha$ then there is not enough evidence to rject $H_0$ 

By convention $\alpha = 0.01 or \alpha = 0.05$

# Hypothesis Testing

A **hypothesis** is a conjecture concerning the value of a problem parameter. 

Requires two competing hypotheses:
- a *null hypothesis*, denoted by $H_0$
- an *alternative hypothesis*, denoted by $H_1$ or $H_A$

The hypothesis is tested by evaluating experimental evidence:
- we *reject* $H_0$ if the evidence against $H_0$ is *strong*
- we *fail to reject* $H_0$ if the evidence against is $H_0$ is *insufficient*

# Errors in Hypothesis Testing

Two types of errors can be committed when testing $H_0$ against $H_1$. 

|  	| Decision: reject $H_0$ 	| Decision: fail to reject $H_0$ 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| Reality: $H_0$ is True 	| Type I Error 	| No Error 	|
| Reality: $H_0$ is False 	| No Error 	| Type II Error 	|

If we reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true ⇒ we have committed a type I error.

If we fail to reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false ⇒ type II error
