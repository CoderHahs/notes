This is a site for me to put everything I've learned in school, online courses, or things that come out of personal interests.

You can search for topics, or go through the left side bar for topics on the left. There are also navigation buttons at the bottom of each page for continuous reading.

If you want to learn more about me, I invite you to check out my [Portifolio](https://hrithikshah.com).
