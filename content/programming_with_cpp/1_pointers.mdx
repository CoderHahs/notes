C++ has pointers, i.e. variables for other addresses (variables,
functions...). In C++, there is an indirect link between arrays and the pointers, that an array identifier is a «constant pointer».

Pointers:
– operators * and &
– «Arithmetic» of pointers
- Link between arrays and pointers
- Dynamic memory management offered by operators new and delete

```cpp
int * ad ; // you can also write : int *ad ;
int n ;
n = 20 ;
ad = &n ;
*ad = 30 ; // you can also write : * ad = 30 ;
```

The following instruction : ```ad = &n ;```
- affects the value of the expression &n to the variable ad. The operator & is a unary operator that provides the result of the address of its operand. Thus, this statement places in the variable ad the address of the n variable. 

The following instruction : ```*ad = 30 ;```
- means: assigning to the lvalue *ad the value 30. But *ad represents the Integer ad address.

# Transmission by address

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std ;
main()
{ 
    void exchange (int *ad1, int *ad2) ;
    int a=10, b=20 ;
    cout << " before call : " << a << " " << b << "\n" ;
    exchange (&a, &b) ;
    cout << " after call : " << a << " " << b << "\n" ;
}
void exchange (int *ad1, int *ad2)
{ 
    int x ;
    x = *ad1 ;
    *ad1 = *ad2 ;
    *ad2 = x ;
}
```

# Arrays and Pointers

An array name is a constant pointer
– In C++, the identifier of an array, when used alone (without index), is considered a (constant) pointer on the beginning of the array.

One-dimensional array
- Consider the following statement : ```int t[10]```
- The notation t is then totally equivalent to &t[0].
- The t identifier is considered to be of the "pointer" type corresponding to the elements of the array, i.e., here, int * (and even more precisely const int *). 

Two ways to place value 1 in each of the 10 items in our array:
```cpp
int i ;
for (i=0 ; i<10 ; i++)
    *(t+i) = 1 ;
// Or :
int i ;
int *p :
for (p=t, i=0 ; i<10 ; i++, p++)
    *p = 1 ;
```

In the second way, we had to copy the value represented by t into a pointer named p. Indeed, the t symbol represents a constant address (t is a pointer type constant on int cases). In other words, an expression such as t++ would have been invalid, just as, for example, 3++. An array name is a constant pointer; it is not lvalue.
