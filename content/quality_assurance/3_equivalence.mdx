# Equivalence Partitioning
It is a software testing technique, like a black box technique. 

The roles:
- it divides the input data of software into different equivalence data classes
- you can apply this technique where there is a range in the input field
- test each partition once

For example if you have some input field where the only possible inputs are numbers between 1 and 10, then your Equivalence Partition Classes would be:
- Valid: Any number between 1-10
- Invalid: Any number <= 0, and any number >= 10

# Boundary Value Analysis:

Valid partitions have 2 more test cases, the min+1 and max+1

For the above example, our EPCs are now:
- Valid: 1, 2, 9, 10
- Invalid: 0, 11

In this case we test the values at the boundaries
