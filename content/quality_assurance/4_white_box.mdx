- structural testing approaches focus on system internal logic
- based on source code
- we test what is actually there
- not implemented functionality in specification may be missed
- can be cumbersome

# Control flow 

- sequencing of statements

## Approaches

- based on the analysis of how control flows through a program
- examples of test coverage criteria
    - statement coverage (all-nodes)
    - branch coverage (all-edges)
    - path coverage (all-paths)
    - condition coverage
    - condition/branch coverage

# Data flow

- data propagation through program
- based on the analysis of how data flows through a program

# Execution path
- a sequence of statements from entry to exit
- typically a large number of paths in a program
- (input, expected output) pair for each path
- executing a path requires invoking the unit with the right test input, some paths may be infeasible

# White box test process

1. Derive flow graph from source code
2. Set coverage goal
3. Determine paths to obtain coverage goal
4. For each path
    - Sensitize path for input values
    - Use specification for expected output
5. Run test cases
6. Check coverage and repeat if needed
