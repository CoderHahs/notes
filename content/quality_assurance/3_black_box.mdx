# Error Guessing

## Approach
1. Make a list of possible errors or error-prone situations
- Error model
2. Design test-cases to cover error model

### Advantages:
- effective complement of other techniques
- quick and efficient
- can be actively developed skill through time

### Disadvantages:
- quality of tests depend on the tester's experience
- metrics about test sufficiency can not be gathered
- not available to in-experience users

# Equivalence Partitioning
It is a software testing technique, like a black box technique. 

The roles:
- it divides the input data of software into different equivalence data classes
- you can apply this technique where there is a range in the input field
- test each partition once

For example if you have some input field where the only possible inputs are numbers between 1 and 10, then your Equivalence Partition Classes would be:
- Valid: Any number between 1-10
- Invalid: Any number <= 0, and any number >= 10

## Myer's Selection Approach

1. Until all valid ECs have been covered by test cases, write a new test cases that covers as many of the uncovered valid ECs as possible
2. Until all invalid ECs have been covered by test cases, write a test case that covers *one, and only one* of the uncovered invalid ECs

# Boundary Value Analysis:

Valid partitions have 2 more test cases, the min+1 and max+1

For the above example, our ECs are now:
- Valid: 1, 2, 9, 10
- Invalid: 0, 11

In this case we test the values at the boundaries.
