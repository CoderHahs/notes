# Error Guessing

## Approach

1. Make a list of possible errors or error-prone situations

- Error model

2. Design test-cases to cover error model

### Advantages:

- effective complement of other techniques
- quick and efficient
- can be actively developed skill through time

### Disadvantages:

- quality of tests depend on the tester's experience
- metrics about test sufficiency can not be gathered
- not available to in-experience users

# Equivalence Partitioning

It is a software testing technique, like a black box technique.

The roles:

- it divides the input data of software into different equivalence data classes
- you can apply this technique where there is a range in the input field
- test each partition once

For example if you have some input field where the only possible inputs are numbers between 1 and 10, then your Equivalence Partition Classes would be:

- Valid: Any number between 1-10
- Invalid: Any number <= 0, and any number >= 10

## Myer's Selection Approach

1. Until all valid ECs have been covered by test cases, write a new test cases that covers as many of the uncovered valid ECs as possible
2. Until all invalid ECs have been covered by test cases, write a test case that covers _one, and only one_ of the uncovered invalid ECs

# Boundary Value Analysis:

Valid partitions have 2 more test cases, the min+1 and max+1

For the above example, our ECs are now:

- Valid: 1, 2, 9, 10
- Invalid: 0, 11

In this case we test the values at the boundaries.

# Category Partitioning

Steps: For each functional units:

1. identify parameters and environment conditions
2. identify categories for each parameter/condition
3. partition each Category in _choices_
4. add constraints to choices
5. create _test frames_ as selection of choices
6. create _test cases_ from _test frames_

# Cause-effect graphing

A systematic way to aid selecting a set of test cases
