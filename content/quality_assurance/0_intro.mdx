#  Terminology

## What is Software Quality?

> Degree to which the software product satisfies stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions

Set of activities aimed at ensuring that few, if any, faults remain in the software system when it is delivered to its customers or released to the market.

Process that ensures that developed software meets and complies with defined or standardized quality goals.


## Five views of Quality:

### Transcendental view

Quality is hard to define in abstract terms.
- can be recognized if present
- some intangible properties that delight users
- ideal that may never be able to completely attained

### User view

- is fit for its purpose, satisfactory
- depends on how product meet its users' needs for tasks
- can be measured based on reliability, usability, accessibility, availability,
safety, accuracy, precision, etc.
- different users will have different needs

### Manufacturing view

- conformance of product to process standards
- depends on how well the product was constructed
- potential to avoid costs associated with rework during development and after delivery
- measure using defect counts, rework costs

#### Conformance to requirements

Lack of defects: # of defects / size unit
- high reliability (number of failures per n hours of operation)
- measured as **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)** probability of failure-free operation in a specified time
- user/customer satisfaction

### Product view

- tied to inherent product characteristics
- one measures and control internal product properties to improve external product behavior
- examples of internal product property measures:
  - size, ratio of code/comments, code, complexity

### Value-based view

- depends on how much customers are willing to pay for trade-off cost and quality

# Quality factors and models

## Characteristics of the overall software quality

- related to purpose and usage of the product
- examples: correctness, reliability, efficiency, testability, maintainability, reusability
- each relevant to specific stakeholders

## Software Quality Model

### Objectives

- define quality characteristics, their attributes, features, sub-characteristics and measurements

### Components

- Functional Suitability
- Performance efficiency
- Compatibility
- usability
- reliability
- security
- maintainability
- portability

#### Quality in Use Model

- effectiveness
- efficiency
- satisfaction
- safety
- context comprehensive-ness

# Errors, faults, failures

key concepts associated to software correctness

**Failure**: inability of a system or component to perform its required functions within specified requirements

**Fault** (defect/bug): an incorrect step, process, or data definition in a software artifact

**Error**: a human action that produces an incorrect result

*Bug/defect/fault* consequence of a human error/mistake results in non-conformance to requirements manifests as *failure* in running software

## Examples of Errors
1. Faulty requirements definition
2. Client-developer communication failures
3. Deliberate deviation from software requirements
4. Design errors
5. Coding mistakes
6. Non-compliance with documentation of coding instructions

## Sample failure situations
1. Software doesn't do something that the specification says it should do
2. Software does somthing that the specification says it shouldn't do
3. Software does something that the specification doesn't mention
4. Software doesn't do something that the specification doesn't mention but should
5. Software is difficult to understand, hard to use, slow, ...
6. Software is viewed by its stakeholders as just plain not right

# Importance of Software Quality
- Software is a major component of computer systems (more than 80% of the cost). Used for:
  - communicaitn
  - health monitoring
  - transportation
  - economic exchange
  - entertainment
- Software defectrs are extremely costly in terms of:
  - money
  - reputation
  - loss of life

## Economic Impact
- $22 - $59 billion dollars lost from Inadequate software testing

## Software Quality Challenge
- high complexity
- invisibility of the product
- limited opportunities to detect defects ('bugs')
- **only opporunity is Product development**
- subjection to customer-supplier relationship
- requirement for teamwork
- need for cooperation and coordination with other development teams
- need for interfaces with other software systems
- need to continue carrying out a project while the team changes
- need to continue maintaining the software system for years

# Objectives of SQA
- Assuring an acceptable level of confidence that the software conform to functional technical requirements
- Assuring an acceptable level of confidence that the software conform to managerial scheduling and budgetary requirements
- Initiation and management of activities for the improvement and greater efficiency of software development, maintenance and SQA activities.
