#  Terminology

## What is Software Quality?

> Degree to which the software product satisfies stated and implied needs when used under
specified conditions

## Five views of Quality:

### Transcendental view

Quality is hard to define in abstract terms.
- can be recognized if present
- some intangible properties that delight users
- ideal that may never be able to completely attained

### User view

- is fit for its purpose, satisfactory
- depends on how product meet its users' needs for tasks
- can be measured based on reliability, usability, accessibility, availability,
safety, accuracy, precision, etc.
- different users will have different needs

### Manufacturing view

- conformance of product to process standards
- depends on how well the product was constructed
- potential to avoid costs associated with rework during development and after delivery
- measure using defect counts, rework costs

#### Conformance to requirements

Lack of defects: # of defects / size unit
- high reliability (number of failures per n hours of operation)
- measured as **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)** probability of failure-free operation in a specified time
- user/customer satisfaction

### Product view

- tied to inherent product characteristics
- one measures and control internal product properties to improve external product behavior
- examples of internal product property measures:
  - size, ratio of code/comments, code, complexity

### Value-based view

- depends on how much customers are willing to pay for trade-off cost and quality

# Quality factors and models

## Characteristics of the overall software quality

- related to purpose and usage of the product
- examples: correctness, reliability, efficiency, testability, maintainability, reusability
- each relevant to specific stakeholders

## Software Quality Model

### Objectives

- define quality characteristics, their attributes, features, sub-characteristics and measurements

### Components

- Functional Suitability
- Performance efficiency
- Compatibility
- usability
- reliability
- security
- maintainability
- portability

#### Quality in Use Model

- effectiveness
- efficiency
- satisfaction
- safety
- context comprehensive-ness

# Errors, faults, failures

key concepts associated to software correctness

**Failure**: inability of a system or component to perform its required functions within specified requirements

**Fault** (defect/bug): an incorrect step, process, or data definition in a software artifact

**Error**: a human action that produces an incorrect result

*Bug/defect/fault* consequence of a human error/mistake results in non-conformance to requirements manifests as *failure* in running software

## Examples of Errors
1. Faulty requirements definition
2. Client-developer communication failures
3. Deliberate deviation from software requirements
4. Design errors
5. Coding mistakes
6. Non-compliance with documentation of coding instructions
