# Objectives of testing
- to find defects
- to bring the tested software to an acceptable level of quality
- to perform the required tests efficiently and effectively
- to compile a record of software errors

# Testing Axioms
Its impossible to test a program completely
- software testing is risk-based
    - need to balance cost and risk of missing defects
- testing can't prove the asbsence of defects
- the more defects you find, the more defects there are likely
- the pesticide paradox
    - a system tends to build resistance to a particular testing technique
- not all defects found are fixed
- defects are not always obvious
- product specifications are never final
- software testers aren't the most popular members of a project team
- software testing is a disciplined technical profession that requires training

# Levels of Testing

- Unit Testing
    - individual program units, such as procedure, methods in isolation
- integration testing
    - modules are assembled to construct larger subsystem and tested
- system testing
    - includes wide spectrus of testing such as functionality, and load
- acceptance testing
    - customer's expectations from the system
