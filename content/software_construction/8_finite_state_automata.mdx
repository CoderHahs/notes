# Creating Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

In order to create a DFA, we have to perform the following:

- create a non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) out of the regular expression
- convert the NFA into a DFA

## NFA Creation Rules

- $A | B$ -> Parallel Circuit
- $AB$ -> Series Circuit
- $A\*$ -> Cycle

## Conversion of an NFA into DFA

NFA is very easy to build but hard to interpret by a computer.

- We need to convert NFA to a DFA
- Subset construction is the algorithm that achieves this conversion

In the transition table of an NFA, each entry is a set of states. In the transition table of a DFA, each entry is at most one state. General idea behind the NFA-to-DFA conversion: each DFA state corresponds to a set of NFA states.

# Subset Construction Algorithm

**Algorithm:** Subset Construction - USed to construct a DFA from an NFA

**Input:** An NFA "N"

**Output:** A DFA "D" accepting the same language

## Method

Let $s$ be a state in $N$ and $T$ be a set of states, using the following operations.

- $\epsilon$-closure($s$): set of NFA states reachable from NFA state $s$ on $\epsilon$-transitions alone
- $\epsilon$-closure($T$): set of NFA states reachable from some NFA state $s$ in $T$ on $\epsilon$-transitions alone
- move($T$, $a$): set of NFA states to which there is a transition on input symbol $a$ from some NFA state $s$ in $T$

## Algorithm (MAIN)

```
add state T = Epsilon-closure(s0) unmarked to *Dstates*
while exists unmarked state $T$ in *Dstates*
  mark T
  for each input symbol a
    U = Epsilon-closure(move(T, a))
    if U does not exist *Dstates* then add U to *Dstates* unmarked
      *Dtrans[T, a]* = U
```

$\epsilon$-closure($s_0$) is the start state of $D$. A state of $D$ is accepting if it contains at least one accepting state in $N$.

## Algorithm (E-closure computation)

```
push all states in T onto stack
initialize Epsilon-closure(T) to T
while stack is not empty
  pop t, the top element off the stack
  for each state u with an edge form t to u labeled E
    if u is not in Epsilon-closure(T)
      add u to Epsilon-closure(T)
      push u onto stack
```

# Minimizing the number of states in DFA

Minimize the number of states of a DFA by finding all groups of states that can be distinguished by some input string. Each group of states that cannot be distinguished is then merged into a single state.

**Algorithm**: minimizing the number of states of a DFA.

**Input**: A DFA $D$ with a set of states $S$

**Output**: A DFA $M$ accepting the same language as $D$ yet having as few states as possible

## Method

1. Construct an initial partition $\Pi$ of the set of states with two groups:

- The accepting (i.e. final) states group
- All other states group

2. Partition $\Pi$ to $\Pi_{\mathrm{new}}$
3. If $\Pi_{\mathrm{new}}$ != $\Pi$, then $\Pi$ = $\Pi_{\mathrm{new}}$ and repeat step 2. Otherwise go to step 4
4. Create a single _DFA M_ state from every group in $\Pi$
5. Specify the accepting (i.e. final) states of _DFA M_. An accepting states in _DFA M_ corresponds to a group in $\Pi$ that contains an accepting state in _DFA D_
6. Specify the initial state of _DFA M_. An initial state in _DFA M_ corresponds to a group to a group in $\Pi$ that contains an initial state in _DFA D_

## Construct New Partition Procedure

For each group G of $\Pi$ do begin. Partition G into subgroups such that two states S and T of G are in the same subgroup if and only if for each symbol $a$ in $\Sigma$:

1. both \$ and T do not have transitions on \$a\$
2. both S and T have transitions on $a$ to states in the same group

Replace G in $\Pi_{\mathrm{new}}$ by the set of all subgroups formed.
