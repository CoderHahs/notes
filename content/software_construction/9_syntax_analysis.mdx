# Context free grammars

A Context Free Grammar (CFG) consists of

- Terminals
- Non-terminals
- Start symbol
- Productions

A language that can be generated by a grammar is said to be a _context-free language_.

## Terminals

They are the basics symbols from which strings are formed. These are the tokens that were produced by the Lexical Analyser

## Non-terminals

They are syntactic variables that denote sets of strings. One non-terminal is distinguished as the **start symbol**.

The **productions** of a grammar specify the manner in which the terminal and non-terminals can be combined to form strings.

# Derivations

```
<expr> = <expr> <op> <expr>
```

This is read as "expr derives expr op expr".

```
<expr> = <expr> <op> <expr>
  = id <op> <expr>
  = id * <expr>
  = id*id
```

This is called a **derivation** of id\*id from expr.

If $A::=\gamma$ is a production and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are arbitrary strings of grammar symbols we say: $\alphaA\beta \Rightarrow \alpha\gamma\beta$

If $\alpha_1 \Rightarrow \alpha_2 \Rightarrow ... \Rightarrow \alpha_n$, we say $\alpha_1$ derives $\alpha_n$.

- $\Rightarrow$ means "derives in one step"
- $\Rightarrow^*$ means "derives in zero or more steps."
- $\Rightarrow^+$ means "derives in one or more steps."

- $G$ is grammar
- $S$ is the start symbol
- $L(G)$ is the language generated by $G$

Strings in $L(G)$ may contain only terminal symbols of $G$. A string of terminals $w$ is said to be in L(G) if and only if $S\Rightarrow^+ W$.

A language that can be generated by a grammar is said to be a context-free language. If two grammars generate the same language, the grammars are said to be equivalent.
