# Introduction

- Introduced by Carl Adam in 1962
- A diagrammatic tool to model concurrency and synchronization in systems
- Fairly similar to UML state Machines
- based on strong mathematical foundation

- **Places** represent possible states of the system
- **Transitions** are vents or actions which cause the change of state
- Every **arc** simply connects a place with a transition or a transition with a place.

## Change of State

A change of state is denoted by a movement of _tokens_ from place to place. This is caused by the _firing_ of a transition. The firing represents an occurrence of the event or an action taken. The firing is subject to the input conditions, denoted by token availability. A transition is _firable_ or _enabled_ when there are sufficient tokens in its input places. After firing, tokens will be transferred from the input places (old state) to the output places, denoting the new state.

## Multiple Local States

Petri nets can be modelled to handle concurrent events.

## Behavioral Properties

- Reachability
  - "can we reach one particular state from another"
- Boundedness
  - can the number of tokens in a place increase infinitely
  - A Petri net is said to be _k-bounded_ or simply _bounded_ if the number of tokens in each place does not exceed a finite number $k$ for any marking reachable from M0
- Liveness
  - will the system die in a particular state
  - A Petri net with initial marking M0 is _live_ if, no matter what marking has been reached from M0, it is possible to ultimately fire _at least a single_ transition by progressing through some further firing sequence.
  - A live Petri net guarantees _deadlock-free_ operation, no matter what firing sequence is chosen.
  - A transition is _dead_ if it can never be fired in any firing sequence
