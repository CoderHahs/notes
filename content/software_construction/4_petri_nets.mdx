# Introduction

- Introduced by Carl Adam in 1962
- A diagrammatic tool to model concurrency and synchronization in systems
- Fairly similar to UML state Machines
- based on strong mathematical foundation

# Components

- **Places** represent possible states of the system
- **Transitions** are vents or actions which cause the change of state
- Every **arc** simply connects a place with a transition or a transition with a place.

## Change of State

A change of state is denoted by a movement of _tokens_ from place to place. This is caused by the _firing_ of a transition. The firing represents an occurrence of the event or an action taken. The firing is subject to the input conditions, denoted by token availability. A transition is _firable_ or _enabled_ when there are sufficient tokens in its input places. After firing, tokens will be transferred from the input places (old state) to the output places, denoting the new state.

## Multiple Local States

Petri nets can be modelled to handle concurrent events.
