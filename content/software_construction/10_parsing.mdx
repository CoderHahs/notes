We saw that top-down parsers may need to backtrack when they select the wrong production. We want to avoid backtracking.

This is where predictive parsers come in useful

- LL(1): left to right scan, left-most derivation, 1-token look ahead
- LR(1): left to right scan, right-most derivation, 1-token look ahead

# LL(1) Grammar

In order to use LL(1) parsers, the context-free grammar has to be:

- unambiguous
- without left recursion
- left factored

# Eliminating Left Recursion

Consider the grammar fragment:

```
<foo> ::= <foo>A
        | B
```

where A and B do not start with `<foo>`. We can re-write this as:

```
<foo> ::= B<bar>
<bar> ::= A<bar>
        | epsilon
```

where `<bar>` is a new non-terminal. This fragment contains no left recursion.

# Left Factoring

For any two productions, we would like a distinct way of choosing the correct production to expand.

We define FIRST (A) as the set of terminals that appear first in some string derived from A.

For a terminal _w_, we can say: $w \in FIRST(A) \iff A \Rightarrow wz$

Now going back to our two productions, we do FIRST(production 1) $\cap$ FIRST(production 2) $=\phi$. This would allow the parser to make a correct choice with a look ahead of only one symbol.

# FIRST and FOLLOW sets

## FIRST Set Calculation

Rules to calculate the FIRST set:

1. FIRST(terminal) is (terminal)
2. If $A ::= a$, and a is a terminal:

- ${a} \in FIRST (A)$

3. If $A ::= B$ and rule B does not exist in grammar:

- $FIRST(B) \in FIRST(A)$

4. If $A ::= B$ and rule B does exist in the grammar:

- ${(FIRST(B) - \epsilon) \cup FIRST(a)} \in FIRST (A)$

## FOLLOW Set Calculation

The follow set of non-terminal $A$ contains all the terminals that appear **after** $A$ in any string generate by the grammar $G$.

Rules to calculate the FOLLOW set:

1. {\$} $\in$ FOLLOW(S)
2. If $A ::= aB$

- FOLLOW(A) $\in$ FOLLOW (B)

3. If $A ::= aBy$ and $y$ does not exist in the grammar

- FIRST(y) $\in$ FOLLOW(B)

4. If $A ::= aBy$ and $y$ does exist in the grammar:

- ${(FIRST(y)-\epsilon)} \cup FOLLOW(A)} \in FOLLOW(B)$

# LL(1) Parsing

In order to implement an LL(1) parser, we need to use the following data structures:

- parse table (2D array)
- stack (contains the derivations)
- list (that will contain the token input stream)

# LL(1) Error Recovery

What happens when the parser discovers an error?

- Approach 1: stop all parsing activity and return an error message
- Approach 2: try to continue parsing (is possible) and see if there are more errors along the way

Which approach does your compiler take?

An error is detected when:

- the terminal on top of the stack does not match the next input token
- the parsing table cell from which we are supposed to pull the next production is empty

What does the parser do?

- It enters the panic-mode error Recovery
- Based on the idea of skipping symbols on the input until a token in the SYNCH set appears

Let $S$ be a set of tokens called a synchronization set (SYNCH). Let $s \in S, s$ is called a synchronization token.

Place all symbols in FOLLOW(A) into the SYNCH(A) set for non-terminal A. If we skip tokens until an element of SYNCH(A) is seen and we pop A from the stack, it's likely that parsing can continue.

The panic-mode error recovery can be implemented using the SYNCH set(s) as follows:

- **Scenario 1**: If there is a non-terminal at the top of the stack, discard input tokens until you find a synch token, then pop the non-terminal
- **Scenario 2**: If there is a terminal at the top of the stack, we could try popping it to see whether we can continue. Assume that the input string is actually missing that terminal

# A NON LL(1) Grammar

Consider the grammar:

```
<stmt> ::= if <expr> then <stmt>
        | if <expr> then <stmt> else <stmt>
```

Needs left factoring, which gives:

```<stmt> ::= if <expr> then <stmt><stmt’>
<stmt’> ::= else <stmt> | ε
```

Let’s get the FIRST and FOLLOW sets

```
FIRST(stmt) = {if}
FIRST(stmt’)={else, ε}
FOLLOW(stmt) = {$, else}
FOLLOW(stmt’)={$, else}
```

The problem arises because for an input token else and stack top of stmt’, we do not know which production to choose:

- `<stmt’> else <stmt>`
- `<stmt’> ε`

Therefore, this is not an LL(1) grammar
