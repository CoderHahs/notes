# Domain Analysis

Domain Analysis is the process by which a software engineer learns background information.

The aim is to understand the problem's domain independently of the particular system we intend to develop.

Benefits:

- faster development, communicate with stakeholders more effectively
- better understanding of user's needs
- anticipation of extensions

Components:

1. Glossary of terms
2. General knowledge about the domain
3. Customers and users
4. Environment
5. Domain Model

- UML class diagram to model the relationship between entities
- Entity relationship model

6. Tasks and procedures currently performed
7. Competing software

# Domain Model

Domain modeling is the decomposition of a domain into its individual entities. It is a way to describe and model domain entities, their responsibilities, and the relationship between them.

These can include but are not limited to:

- UML class diagrams
- Entity relationship model

# Requirements

## Customer Requirements

These requirements help figure out exactly what the customer wants.

**Requirements Elicitation** (more on this found [here]("https://hrithiks-notes.netlify.app/software_requirements/3_requirements_elicitation")):

- where the expectations of the customer are captured
- done through interviews
- high-level, non-technical statements

## Functional Requirements

Capture the intended behavior of the system.

## Use Case View

Captures the behavior of the system as it appears to an outside actor.

## Non-functional Requirements

Define what a system is supposed to do. Describe security, reliability, maintainability, scalability, usability.
