# Analysis of Existing Systems

- Useful when building a new improved version of an existing system (automated or not)
- Important to know:
- What is used, not used, or missing
- What works well, what does not work
- How the system:
    - Is used (with frequency and importance) 
    - Was supposed to be used
    - Can be reused (even if partly)
- Also important to do for competing systems and for related systems
    - What are they for your project?
- Users may become disillusioned with a new system or may not like this new system if it is too different from what currently exists or does not do what they want 
    - Risk of nostalgia towards the “gool old system”
- To appropriately take into account real usage patterns, human issues, common activities, relative importance of tasks/features
- To catch obvious possible improvements 
    - Features that are missing or do not currently work well
- To find out which “legacy” features can/cannot be left out
    - And those that should be reused

# Review Available Documentation

- Start by studying available documentation
    - User documents (manual, guides, procedures…)
    - Development documents and change requests/histories
    - Requirements documents (possibly for requirements reuse!)
    - Data structures, communication interfaces, GUIs
    - Relevant regulations and standards
- Of course, the above are often out of date, poorly written, wrong, etc., but they still represent a good starting point!
- Complement with observations and analysis of usage data

# Observations

Observation 
- Get into the trenches and observe specialists “in the wild”
- Shadow important potential users as they do their work 
- Silent approach, or ask user to explain everything he or she is doing  
- Session videotaping and coding

Challenges
- Takes time and expertise! 
- Also needs observed people to agree…
- Observed people can also be conscious of the presence of external observers and change their behaviour accordingly (Hawthorne effect)

## Ethnography: more scientific observations

- Comes from anthropology, literally means “writing the culture”
- Essentially seeks to explore the human factors and social organization of activities -> understand work
    - Studies have shown that work is often richer and more complex than is suggested by simple models derived from interviews
- Discoveries are made by observation and analysis
- Aim to make the implicit explicit!
- Useful to discover, for example
    - What does an Academic Assistant do during the day?
    - What does their workspace look like?
- May need to team up with social scientists!

# Usage/Comment Data Analysis

## For Existing and Evolving Systems...

- Shift requirements focus from intuition and experience of stakeholders to rational and explainable decisions based on implicit and explicit user data
- Move from reactive evolution to real-time and even proactive decision-making about requirements and priorities.
- Challengers:
    - Is data available?
    - Can the data be trusted?

## Crowdsourcing Requirement

- The crowd and social media represent potential sources of data-driven requirements
- For example
    - Dozens of emergency applications exist to support people during catastrophes
    - Recent events (e.g., Fort McMurray fires, summer 2016) yet suggest there utility is limited.
- Can we analyze social media information (e.g., Twitter feeds) to discover more appropriate requirements?

### Sample Crowdsourced Requirements

- Top 10 in-demand features based on the analysis of nearly 70,000 tweets related to the Fort McMurray (AB) fires in 2016
    - Fire alarm notification
    - Food and water requests and resource
    - Emergency maintenance service
    - Send emergency text messages
    - Safety guidelines
    - Fire and safeness warning
    - Request ambulance at a tap
    - Find nearest gas station
    - Emergency zones maps
    - Find a medical centre
- How many of these were found in the dozens of emergency apps on the market?
    - None! Only six of the features existing in wildfire apps are among top 40 crowdsourced features explored!

## Mining App Features from Tweets (MAPFEAT)

1. Mine informative communications
2. NLP for understanding discussed requirements
3. Search in the requirements in the app store
4. Extract app features
5. Retrieve features common between apps
6. Crowd validation
7. Specify mobile apps


## A/B testing

- A/B testing is the act of running a simultaneous experiment between two or more variants of a system to see which one performs the best

Useful when:
- Frequent deployment is easy
    - Web-based system
    - Auto-updated mobile app…
- Lots, lots of users
- Developing alternative features is easier than eliciting requirements through conventional means!

Procedure:
1. Develop variants (incremental feature)
2. Assign variants to random users
3. Gather and analyze data
4. Keep winner as new baseline and start again with new variants


## Implications for Requirements Engineering
1. Consider eliciting as few requirements as you can before building the MVP
2. Instrument product, and collect and analyze data to constantly validate your selection and prioritization
3. Model the expected value rather than express the requirements

Where is such A/B testing approach not easily applicable?
- Few users available
- Systems that cannot be frequently updated
- Systems where variant development is expensive
- Systems that involve much more than software

Nice to have requirements:
- System instrumentation to produce usage logs?
- Sending specific usage information to a server?
- Catching and reporting bugs and performance issues to a server?
- Informing users about data collection?
- Leaving users a choice about whether to participate or not (privacy)?
- Ensuring the security and confidentiality of the data collected?
- Ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations?
