- There are too many requirements!
- From many different sources
- Resources are limited (budget, time, expertise, etc.)
- Establishing priorities is important, but:
    - Which requirements are truly important, and to whom?
    - How to prioritize them? On what basis? What to minimize/maximize?
    - In which iteration should the requirement be considered?
- Developers may not know the business value of some requirements, and clients may not know the implementation complexity (or cost) of some requirements...
- Different stakeholders have different (and often conflicting) goals and different priorities
- Some stakeholders’ decisions carry more weight than others
- Companies often lack systematic data, metrics, and technologies to support the prioritization process
    - Often done manually, informally, on an ad-hoc basis
    - Difficult to establish and communicate 
- Attitude!
    - "No need for priorities, we can do everything in the specification!“
        - Yes, but when and at what cost?
    - Suddenly, when the deadline is fast approaching, some requirements are put aside in order to deliver something on time... 

# Requirements Prioritization and Triage

- Requirements prioritization is also referred to as triage
- Need to decide which requirements really matter, e.g., those that need to be implemented in the next release
- Need for compromise, negotiation, priorities
- Prioritization must help:
    - Make acceptable the trade-offs among quality, cost, and time-to-market goals
    - Allocate resources based on importance of requirements to the project as a whole (project planning)
    - Determine when a requirements should become part of the product
    - Offer the right product!

## 80-20 Rule

- 20% of functionalities provide 80% of revenues
    - Think of MS Word...
- The remaining 80% of functionalities offer a lower return on investment while adding delays, development costs, maintenance costs...
- How to find the most useful and beneficial 20% of functionalities and qualities?

## Triage Process

- Shall be simple and fast, for industry adoption
- Shall yield accurate and reliable results
- Shall consider issues such as
    - The value of requirements to stakeholder (maximize) 
    - The cost of implementation (minimize) 
    - Time to market (to minimize)
- Important to agree on requirements granularity
    - E.g., user stories, features, detailed requirements...

## 1st Technique: Prioritization Scales

- Determine criteria, granularity, scale dimensions
- Frequently used:
        - Urgency
        - High (mission critical requirement; required for next release)
        - Medium (supports necessary system operations; required eventually but could wait until a later release if necessary)
        - Low (a functional or quality enhancement; would be nice to have someday if resources permit)
    - Importance
        - Essential (product unacceptable unless these requirements are satisfied)
        - Conditional (would enhance the product, but the product is acceptable if absent)
        - Optional (functions that may or may not be worthwhile)
- Similar to your project deliverable #1... Valid and scalable?

### Prioritization Based on Cost and Value

- Calculate return on investment by
    - Assessing the value of each requirement
    - Assessing the cost of each requirement
    - Calculating the cost-value trade-offs
- Difficulties
    - Hard to calculate absolute value and cost figures, in $$$ 
        - Relative value/cost figures are easier to obtain
    - Interdependent requirements difficult to treat individually

## 2nd Technique: Wiegers' Prioritization

- Semi-quantitative analytical approach to requirements prioritization based on value, cost, and risk
- Relies on estimation of relative priorities of requirements
    - Dimensions
        - Relative benefit (for having requirement)
        - Relative penalty to stakeholder (if requirement is not included)
        - Relative cost (to implement requirement)
        - Relative risk (technical and other risks)
    - Each dimension is given a value on a scale (e.g., 0..9)
    - Dimensions have relative weights
- Formula used to derive overall priority, e.g.:
    - value(i) % = (2 \* benefit(i) + penalty(i)) / 2\*benefit(i) + penalty(i)) 
    - priority = (value%) / ((cost% * cost weight) + (risk% * risk weight))
- Still limited by ability to properly estimate
    - Requires adaptation and calibration

### Risk

- risk = the effect of the uncertainty on objectives
- Not just a “chance or probability of loss” now a risk refers to positive or negative possibilities
- Identify, characterize uncertainty (threats / opportunities)
- Assess susceptibility of critical assets to specific threats / opportunities
- Determine risks (i.e., potential damage|gain x probability of occurrence)
- Identify ways to reduce negative risks (mitigation)
- Prioritize risk reduction measures based on a strategy
- Product or process-related risks

## 3rd Technique: Kano Surveys

- The Kano Model is a method for grouping requirements based on customer perception, in order to select the requirements that deliver the greatest customer satisfaction
    - Basic: requirements that the customer takes for granted
    - Excitement: requirements that the customer does not request or expect
    - Performance: requirements that the customer specifically asked for
    - Indifferent: requirements that the customer does not care about
    - Reverse: “requirements” that the customer hates

### Questions and Answers in Kano Surveys

- Ask customers what their reaction would be if the requirement were included in the product (i.e., functional question)
- Ask customers what their reaction would be if the requirement were NOT included in the product (i.e., dysfunctional question)
- The possible answers (for each) are:
    - I like it 
    - I expect it
    - I am neutral
    - I can tolerate it
    - I dislike it

## 4th Technique: Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)


- Developed by Karlsson and Ryan (1997) based on work by Saaty (early 1970) 
    - see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_Hierarchy_Process
- Solves the problem of having to deal with relative values and weights
    - Everything could be “important” to someone...
- Forces ranking through pairwise comparisons
    - Which requirement (A or B) is more important: A << <=> >> B
- Can be used for requirements, features, stories... in terms of value but also in terms of costs

### Steps:
1. Requirements engineers check individual requirements for ambiguities, completeness. ..
2. Apply AHP’s pairwise comparison to estimate the relative value of candidate requirements
3. Experienced software engineers use AHP’s pairwise comparison to estimate the cost of candidate requirements
4. Plot these values on a cost-value diagram
5. Stakeholders use this diagram for analysis and to make trade-off

### Pairwise Comparisons: Problems and Solutions

- Large number of pairs: pairwise comparison can be tedious
    - Solved using transitivity and other tricks!
    - Mathematical optimization of the number of pairs to be considered (no need to cover all)
    - If A>>B and B>>C, do we have to ask about A compared to C?
    - Partial sampling (according to time/budget) can help 
- Many dependencies between requirements
    - Can actually be used to further reduce the # of pairs
    - E.g., group many requirements as features, use cases, services..
- Complexity handled by grouping requirements per feature
    - Fewer pairs to check; if we go from 100 requirements to compare to 10 features to compare, is this much faster?
- Complexity handled by targeting questions per stakeholder
    - Not all stakeholders are interested in all requirements!

### AHP: Stakeholders

- Each client is unique!
- Each stakeholder group may have a different weight
    - For example, the European and Japanese markets may have different preferences and offer different opportunities
- Example 
    - Stakeholders M1 to M10 are different markets
    - A to P are different features
- Important conflicts here might lead to a family of products, with one product per relevant market...
