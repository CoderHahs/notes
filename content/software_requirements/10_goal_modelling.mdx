# Goals and Rationales

- **Rationale** is the reasoning that leads to the system
- Rationales include
    - Issues that were addressed
    - Alternatives that were considered
    - Decisions that were made to resolve the issues
    - Criteria that were used to guide decisions
    - Debate developers went through to reach a decision
- Very similar to the “analytic nature” of SEG co-op reports!

- **Goal**: high-level objective of the business, organization, or system
- A requirement specifies how a goal should be accomplished by a proposed system
- Operationalization: the process of defining a goal with enough detail so that its sub-goals have an operational definition
- Decomposition: the process of subdividing a set of goals into a logical sub-grouping so that system requirements can be more easily understood, defined, and specified
- Obstacles: behaviours or other goals that prevent or block the achievement of a given goal
- Abstracting and identifying goal obstacles allows one to consider the possible ways for goals to fail and anticipate exception cases

## Use of Rationales
- Improve design support
- Avoid duplicate evaluation of poor alternatives
- Make consistent and explicit trade-offs
- Improve documentation support
- Makes it easier for non developers (e.g., users, managers, lawyers) to review the design
- Improve maintenance support
- Provide maintainers with design context
- Improve learning
- New staff can learn the design by replaying the decisions that produced it


# Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL)


- The Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL)
    - Is a standardized graphical and textual notation, part of URN
    - Connects requirements to business objectives
    - Allows reasoning about (non-functional) requirements and tradeoffs
    - Is based on i* and the NFR Framework (U. Toronto)
    - Supports indicators, strategies, and extension mechanisms
- GRL models “why” aspects
    - Goals, alternatives, and rationales
    - Little or no operational/sequencing detail
- Supports goal and trade-offanalysis and evaluations
    - Which stakeholders will be happy about these decisions?
- Nothing comparable in UML, SysML or BPMN...

## GRL Notation

- Intentional elements
    - Goal, softgoal (or quality), task 
    - GRL resources and beliefs are not used in this course
- Achievement of a softgoal is qualifiable but not entirely measurable; it is quantifiable for goals (more binary too)
    - Softgoal ...often non-functional or quality
    - Goal ... often functional
- A task is a proposed solution that can achieve a goal and contribute to softgoals/qualities
- An indicator transforms a measure to a satisfaction level


- Contribution Link
    - A contribution describes desired impact orside effects (positive or negative)
    - Qualitative (symbols) or quantitative (numbers) contribution types are used for these links
- Decomposition Link
    - Defines what an intentional element needs to be satisfied
        - AND
        - OR
        - XOR
- Dependency Link (source target)
    - The source of the dependency cannot be more satisfied than its target

## Recurring Pattern in Goal Modelling

- The system (actor) has several functional goals, with various alternative ways of performing them (shown with tasks)
- There are several stakeholders (actors) involved, with their own concerns, often non-functional (captured with softgoals)
- There are known contributions and side-effects from the potential solutions to the softgoals

## Why Goals

- Goals become an important driver for requirements elaboration – yet, stakeholders goals and objectives are complex and will conflict...
- GRL expresses and clarifies tentative, ill-defined, and ambiguous requirements
    - Supports argumentation, negotiation, conflict detection & resolution, and in general decisions
    - Captures decision rationale and criteria (documentation!)
- GRL identifies alternative requirements and alternative system boundaries (scope)
- GRL provides clear traceability from strategic objectives to technical requirements
- GRL allows reuse of stable higher-level goals when the system evolves

## User Stories and Goal models

- Pattern: As an [Actor], I want to [Task] in order to [Contribution] achieve [Goal]
- This user story identifies the task of an actor, a contribution level, and a contribution from the task to a goal (inside or outside the actor)
- Ex: As a professor, I want to use Brightspace in order to help minimize the number of lost assignments.

# Goal Model Analysis

## Strategies and Evaluation Mechanism

- GRL allows a particular configuration of intentional elements to be defined in a strategy (i.e., one possible solution)
    - Captures the initial, user-defined satisfaction levels for these elements separately from the GRL graphs
    - Intentional elements tagged with (*) in jUCMNav
    - Strategies can be compared with each other for trade-off analysis
- In order to analyze the goal model and compare solutions with each other, jUCMNav’s customizable evaluation mechanism executes the strategies 
    - Propagating satisfaction levels to the other elements and to actors shows impact of proposed solution on high level goals for each stakeholder
    - Propagation starts at user-defined satisfaction levels of intentional elements (usually bottom-up)
- Evaluations of GRL graphs show the impact of qualitative decisions on high level soft goals
- Evaluation mechanism takes into consideration:
    - Initial satisfaction levels of children (from a strategy)
    - Links, types of these links, and contribution/decomposition types
    - Importance defined for intentional elements and actors
- More complete than simple pros/cons tables or criteria evaluation matrices

# Indicators

- GRL includes a notion of goal satisfaction, with qualitative and quantitative ([-100..100] or [0..100]) scales.
- However, there is often a need to better relate observations about the real world to the goal model, with domain-specific units such as:
    - Currencies (e.g., revenues in $)
    - Durations (e.g., waiting time in a hospital, in hours)
    - Counts (e.g., number of new students admitted in SEG)
- GRL supports this kind of information, and integrates it in the rest of the goal model
    - Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
- KPIs help measure goals and NFRs with quantifiable metrics
- GRL KPIs can also be fed from external sources of information, hence turning the GRL model into a monitoring engine (e.g., a dashboard).

## Key Performance Indicators

- In GRL, a KPI is defined as an intentional element, but with additional characteristics
    - Attributes (for a given GRL strategy)
        - An evaluation value (observed, or simulated in a what-if strategy)
        - A target value (the KPI is fully satisfied if the evaluation value reaches or exceeds it)
        - A worst-case value (the KPI is fully denied if the evaluation value reaches it)
        - A threshold value (the KPI is neutral if the evaluation value equals it)
        - A unit (e.g., $)
    - Liens (for a given GRL model)
        - Source of contributions
        - Target of decompositions and dependencies

# Goal/Process Consistency and Completeness

## From Goal Models to Process Models - URN Links

- URN Links (typed) establish traceability relationships
    - Connect any pair of URN model elements
    - Most frequently, URN links are used to trace ...
        - Actors in GRL models and corresponding components in UCM models
        - Tasks in GRL models and corresponding maps/processes or responsibilities in UCM models

## Integrating Goals and Processes

- Refinements of alternative solutions 
    - From GRL goals (identification) to UCM processes (operationalization) 
- Traceability enables the analysis of completeness (anything missing?) and consistency (are the views aligned?)
    - Under-specification: discovery of new goals or process elements
    - Over-specification: removal of unnecessary goals or process elements
- Examples:
    - Why is there a UCM process without any link to a GRL goal?
    - Why is there a GRL goal without any link to a UCM process?
