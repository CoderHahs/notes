# Anatomy of a Good Requirement
> "The Online Banking System shall allow the Internet user to access her current account balance in less than 5 seconds"
- defines the system under discussion
- verb with correct identifier (shall or may)
- defines a positive end result
- quality criterion

# Standard for Writing a Requirement

- Each requirement must first form a **complete** sentence
    - not a bullet list of buzzwords.
- several standards define how to use key words (verbs and adjectives) in their documents.

Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels
- MUST, REQUIRED, or SHALL
    - mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the spec
- MUST NOT or SHALL NOT
    - absolute prohibition
- SHOULD OR RECOMMENDED
    - think twice about not doing it!
- SHOULD NOT OR NOT RECOMMENDED
    - think twice about doing it!
- MAY OR OPTIONAL
    - truly optional

## Characteristics

Look for the following:
- **Needed** (provides the specifics of a desired end goal or result)
- **Feasible** (not wishful thinking, take resources into account)
- **Testable/Verifiable** (contains a success criterion/other measurable indication of quality)
- Unambiguous, precise, concise, correct, singular (one thought)
- identifiable along all its life

## Pitfalls

- never describe prematurely **how** the system is going to achieve something (over-specification), always describe **what** the system is supposed to do
    - danger signs: using names of components, materials, software objects, etc.
- avoid ambiguity
- don't make multiple requirements

This is a requirement with a Pitfall
> "The system shall use Microsoft Outlook to send an email to the customer with the purchase confirmation."

# Simple Tests

- What vs. How
    - Example: a requirement may specify an ordinary differential equation that must be solved, but it should not mention that a fourth order Runge-Kutta method should be employed
- "What is ruled out" test
    - does the requirement actually make a decision
- "Negation" test
    - if the negation of a requirement represents a position that someone might argue for, then the original decision is likely to be meaningful.
    - Failing that test may indicate the presence of a goal that still needs to be refined into requirements

# Typical Mistakes

- Noise = the presence of text that carries no relevant information to any feature of the problem
- Silence = a feature that is not covered by any text
- Over-specification = text that describes a feature of the solution, rather than the problem
- Contradiction = text that defines a single feature in a number of incompatible ways
- Ambiguity = text that can be interpreted in >=2 different ways
- Forward reference = text that refers to a feature yet to be defined
- Wishful thinking = text that defines a feature that cannot possibly be validated
- Jigsaw puzzles = e.g., distributing requirements across a document and then cross-referencing
- Inconsistent terminology = inventing and then changing terminology
- Putting the onus on the development staff = i.e. making the reader work hard to decipher the intent
- Writing for the hostile reader (fewer of these exist than friendly ones)

# Patterns for Functional Requirements:

A **Ubiquitous** requirement is continually active and takes the form The <system name> shall <system response>
- A **State-driven** requirement is active while some precondition remains true and takes the form WHILE <precondition> the <system name> shall <system response>
- An **Event-driven** requirement is activated when a triggering event is detected at the system boundary and takes the form WHEN <trigger> the <system name> shall <system response>
- An **Option** requirement is used for systems that include a particular feature and take the form WHERE <feature is included> the <system name> shall <system response>
- An **Unwanted Behavior** requirement defines the required system response to an unwanted external event and takes the form IF <trigger> THEN the <system name> shall <system response>
- The basic EARS (Easy To Approach Requirement Syntax) patterns can be combined to build Complex requirements

# Requirement Specifications

- Structured collection of the essential requirements (characteristics, functions, qualities, constraints, and attributes) of the system and its external interfaces
- Basis for contractual agreements between contractors or suppliers and customers

## Standards

A standard is a “Set of mandatory requirements established by consensus and maintained by a recognized body to prescribe a disciplined uniform approach or specify a product, that is, mandatory conventions and practices”. 

## Levels of Abstraction

### Business Requirement Specification

The Business Requirements Specification (BRS) describes the organization’s motivation for why the system is being developed or changed, defines processes and policies/rules under which the system is used and documents the top-level requirements from the stakeholder perspective. 

The BRS describes how the organization is pursuing new business or changing the current business in order to fit a new business environment, and how to utilize the system as a means to contribute to the business. 

### StakeHolder Requirement Specification

The Stakeholder Requirements Specification (StRS) describes the organization’s motivation for why the system is being developed or changed, defines processes and policies/rules under which the system is used and documents the top-level requirements from the stakeholders’ perspective including expressing needs of users/operators/maintainers as derived from the context of use in a specific, precise and unambiguous manner. 

In the context described in the BRS, the StRS describes how the organization will utilize the system as a means to contribute to the business.

### System Requirement Specification

The System Requirements Specification (SyRS) identifies the technical requirements for the selected system-of-interest and usability for the envisaged human-system interaction.

It defines the high-level system requirements from the domain perspective, along with background information about the overall objectives for the system, its target environment and a statement of the constraints, assumptions and non-functional requirements.

### Software Requirement Specification
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a specification for a particular software product, program, or set of programs that performs certain functions in a specific environment. 

The SRS may be written by one or more representatives of the supplier, one or more representatives of the acquirer, or by both.

Note:The structure of section 3 may vary substantially

## Writing Good Requirement Specifications

- Consistent
    - Does not contradict itself (satisfiable)
    - Avoid synonyms for terms
    - Note: inconsistency can be hard to detect, especially in concurrency/timing aspects and condition logic
    - Formal modeling can help
- Beneficial
    - Has benefits that outweigh the costs of development
- Modifiable
    - Will have to be updated
- Complete
    - Specifies all the things the system must do (including contingencies)
    - ...and all the things it must not do!
    - Conceptual Completeness(e.g., responses defined for all classes of input)
    - Structural Completeness(e.g., no TBDs in sections)
- Feasible
    - Can be entirely realized and validated within known constraints (e.g., cost, schedule, technical) with acceptable risk
