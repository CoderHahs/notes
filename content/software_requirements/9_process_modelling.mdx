- Process modelling is the activity of representing processes of stakeholders or an enterprise, so that the current processes may be analyzed, improved, or automated
- Process modelling enables to represent who does what,  when, and possibly where
- Process modelling gives an opportunity to 
    - Capture operational information from observations, documents, interviews, and questionnaires about existing ways of working (i.e. processes) of stakeholders
    - Integrate userstoriesand other operational scenarios together to analyze commonalities, alternatives, and potential conflicts
    - Anticipate the processes to be followed by the users of the future system

## User Requirement Notation


- URN is the first and currently only standard that explicitly addresses goals in addition to processes in graphical and textual ways in one unified language. URN combines:
    - Goal-oriented Requirement Notation (GRL), especially good for NFRs
    - Use Case Maps (UCM), especially good for processes
- About the URN standard
    - International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T Z.150 series)
    - United Nation organization: 193 countries + member companies
    - ITU-T Z.150 (02/03, revised 02/11): User Requirements Notation (URN) - Language requirements and framework
    - ITU-T Z.151 (11/08, corrigendum 2011, revised 2012 and 2018): User Requirements Notation (URN) - Language definition
    - Metamodel, abstract/concrete graphical and textual syntaxes, semantics...

### Bird's Eye View of URN

GRL
- intentional elements + actors + links + indicators + strategies

UCM
- responsibilities + causality + component + scenarios


- Although UCMs are used here to explain process modelling, most process notations share common concepts:
    - Start
    - End
    - Activity
    - Sequence
    - Alternatives (with conditions)
    - Concurrency
    - Decomposition...

# Use Case Maps


- Use Case Maps
    - Graphical and textual scenario/process modelling notation 
    - Causal relationships between responsibilities
    - Scenario elements may (optionally) be allocated to components
- UCM models support
    - Functional requirements as scenarios/processes
    - Integration and reusability of scenarios/processes
    - Guidance for architecture and detailed behaviour
    - Conflict detection
    - Transformations
    - Performance analysis

# Process Analysis and Traversal


- As seen for models in general, there are benefits in creatingand inspecting process models, as the language/notation forces some rigour, and so do supporting tools that understand its syntax (i.e., not PowerPoint or Visio)
- But some languages and tools also support some level of simulation or executability that helps:
    - Animate specific scenario runs in a process model, for validation
    - Extract execution traces (e.g., as sequence diagrams) for testing
    - Check properties such as absence of deadlocks, non-determinism, race conditions, or modeller-defined properties
    - Simulate different loads, for performance assessment
    - Detect undesirable interactions between processes coming from different stakeholders and other sources
- Requires additional precision, with data and conditions
- Example: UCM traversal, supported by the jUCMNav tool

## Use Case Maps Notation: Data language


- URN includes a simple a data language for conditions and statements
- Subset of SDL’s data language (ITU-T Rec.  Z.100), supporting only 3 types
- Boolean, Integer, and Enumeration 
- Concrete textual syntax that supports both SDL and Java/C expressions and operators
    - Condition: ```x>100 && day==MONDAY```
    - Statement: ```if (var1 || var2) then var3=35;```

## Possible Problems with Multiple Conditions


- In process models (e.g., UCM or BPMN), OR-forks (and dynamic stubs) are locations where the conditions can lead to common issues
- For example, assume two Boolean variables A and B:
    - Condition 1: A || B
    - Condition 2: A && B
- If these conditions guard branches or plug-ins, what are the two main issues that can happen?
    1.Non-determinism: There exist values for which more than one condition are true at the same time. For example: A=T, B=T
        - If not solved: random behaviour!
    2.Incompleteness: There exist values for which all conditions are false at the same time. For example: A=F, B=F
        - If not solved: deadlock!
- Your challenge is to ensure that conditions in a UCM OR-fork or in a dynamic stub are deterministic and complete (and making sense)

## Summary


- Model processconcepts – mainly for workflow, operational, and functional requirements
- Like most process modeling notations, UCMs provide: 
    - Coverage of basic process modelling concepts
    - Visual description of behavior superimposed over entities (from software and hardware components to actors)
    - Combined system view – integrate many scenarios/processes
    - Effective documentation tool for people unfamiliar with the domain
- More uniquely, UCMs also provide:
    - Executability enabling requirements analysis
        - Enables reasoning about potential undesirable interactions of processes
        - Validation of specific scenarios with stakeholders
        - Path towards design and implementation
    - Integration with goal models in URN

# Scenario Export: UCM Model

- Scenarios can be exported to:
    - UCM model where all scenarios are linearized
        - Stubs flattened and choices resolved (but documented with special waiting places) 
    - UCM model where all scenarios are linearized and well-formed
        - From graph to “tree” (especially for AND-joins)
        - Some concurrency may be lost along the way

## Key Points: Scenario Definitions 

- Improves understanding of (lengthy) scenarios
- Validation and regression testing
- UCM data model is not a domain data model
- Simpler, aims to support scenario execution
- Scenario definitions are the foundation for more advanced functionality based on UCM path traversal mechanisms (highlight, transformations)
- Much value here in a tool-supported translation

# Process Mining

- The use of data (event logs) to discover existing processes from evidence, and generate a corresponding process model
- Uses a combination of data mining and some A.I.
- Shows the real as-is process rather than what people think the process is
