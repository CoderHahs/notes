# Requirement Analysis and Modelling

- Candidate requirements, user stories, GUI prototypes elicited from different sources need to be analyzed for:
    - Consistency (are there contradictions, incompatibilities, or conflicts?)
    - Completeness (are there gaps that deserve more elicitation?)
    - Usefulness (are these artifacts actually helpful?)
- The objectives are 
    - To produce system and software requirements specifications that make sense
    - To produce more formal artifacts that can support development and testing
- Modelling often helps here!

# Models


- According to Bran Selic, a model is a reduced representation (simplified, abstract) of (one aspect of) a system used to:
    - Help understand complex problems and / or solutions
    - Communicate information about the problem / solution
    - Direct implementation (especially in software)
- Qualities of a good model
    - Abstract
    - Understandable
    - Accurate
    - Predictive
    - Inexpensive

# Model Based Analysis


- By construction
    - We learn by questioning and describing the system
- By inspection
    - Execute/analyze the model in our minds
    - Incomplete, but good for learning
- By formal analysis
    - Requires formal semantics (mathematical) and tools
    - Reliable (in theory), but expensive (for certain modeling approaches)
- By experimentation
    - Execution, simulation, animation, test...
    - Requires well-defined semantics and execution/simulation tools
    - More reliable than inspection for certain aspects
    - Possible to interact directly with the model (prototype)

# UML Diagrams Most Relevant for R.E.


- Use case diagram
    - Use cases structuring
- Activity diagram
    - Workflow and process modeling
- Sequence diagram
    - Modeling of message exchange scenarios
- Class diagram
    - Domain modeling
- State machine diagram
    - Detailed behavioral specification (of objects, protocols, ports...)
    - System behaviour (black box)
    - Object/document lifecycles

# Domain Modeling in Requirements Engineering


- It is important to define
    - The concepts that exist in a domain where requirements are being specified
        - Provides the basic terminology/vocabulary for requirements and stories!
    - The particular attributes of these concepts
    - The relationships that exist between these concepts
        - Generalization, aggregation, others more domain-specific...
- Class diagrams are ideal to capture this information!
- But a precise subset is useful here...
    - Avoid unnecessary complex features of UML class diagrams!

## Class Diagrams for Precise Domain Modeling


- No operations!
- Attributes with types
    - Use associations when types are other classes
- Associations with precise multiplicities
    - Beware of fixed numbers... and of 1..1 associations!
- Names for association ends (roles) must be used instead of a simple name for the association itself
    - Less confusing, especially for expressing constraints
- Enumerations are also useful
- Beware of generalization
    - Yes, design patterns are useful here too!
- Supplement with constraints for precision wherever needed
    - In natural language (using the names of classes, attributes, and association ends in the model) or OCL (Object Constraint Language)

## Constraints for More precision
- UML class diagrams have their limitations...
- The name of a Course shall be unique among all Courses
- The weight of an Assessment shall be between 0 and 100
- The weights of assessments of a Course shall sum up to 100
- The assessments of a Student shall only be assessments of courses this Student is taking

```UML
-- The name of a Course shall be unique among all Courses
context Course
    inv UniqueName:
        Course.allInstances -> isUnique(name)
-- The weight of an Assessment shall be between 0 and 100
context Assessment
    inv ValidWeight:
        weight >= 0 and weight <= 100
-- The weights of assessments of a Course shall sum up to 100
context Course
    inv ValidTotalAssessmentsWeight:
        assessments.weight->sum() = 100
-- The assessments of a Student shall only be assessments of Courses this
-- Student is taking
context Student
    inv AssessmentselongToStudentsCourse:
            assessments->forAll (a : Assessment | courses->includes(a.course))
```

# Artifact Lifecycles with UML State Machine Diagrams

- Artifacts include documents, requests, bugs, requirements... of value to the system
- Often, artifacts have states that change according to some event or condition
- The different states and transitions of an artifact (i.e., how it evolves during its life) represent its lifecycle
- Understanding the lifecycle of an artifact helps analyze completeness and helps minimize complexity
- Lifecycle models can also influence the design of interaction mechanisms (e.g., GUIs) with users
    - Can restrict/simplify what possible interactions are available next
- UML state machine diagrams can help here

## Modeling Behavior

- In general, state machines are suitable for describing discrete reactive systems based or events
    - Including lifecycles!
- Not appropriate to describe continuous systems (e.g., spacecraft trajectory control, stock market predictions)

## State Machine Diagrams for Lifecycles


- States, transitions with events [and conditions] are essential
- Hierarchical states and orthogonal regions should be used only if they simplify the model
- Lifecycles include fewer actions than conventional state-based behavior descriptions
    - Entry/exit/do actions of limited use
- Advanced UML features such as history pseudostates are not useful for lifecycles
- Keep models simple yet useful!
