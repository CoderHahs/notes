# Exploring Undirected Graph

Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph.

Task: Find all vertices that can be reached from a given vertex $v \in V$.

```python
def explore(v):
    visited(v) = True
    previsit(v) # see later
    for each edge {u,v} in E do:
        if visited(u) = False:
            call explore(u)
    postvisit(v) # see later
```

The number of vertices u such that “visited(u) = false” decreases in each recursive call. Since there is a finite number of vertices, the algorithm eventually terminates.
