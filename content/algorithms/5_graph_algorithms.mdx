# Exploring Undirected Graph

Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph.

Task: Find all vertices that can be reached from a given vertex $v \in V$.

```python
def explore(v):
    visited(v) = True
    previsit(v) # see later
    for each edge {u,v} in E do:
        if visited(u) = False:
            call explore(u)
    postvisit(v) # see later
```

The number of vertices u such that “visited(u) = false” decreases in each recursive call. Since there is a finite number of vertices, the algorithm eventually terminates.

## Lemma

Assume that, initially, *visited(u)* = False. After explore(v) has terminated, *visited(u)* = True $\iff$ there is a path from $v$ to $u$.

## Connected Components of G = (V, E)

```python
def DFS (G):
  for all v in V do:
    visited (v) = false
  cc = 0
  for all v in V do:
    if visited (v) = false:
      cc = cc + 1
      explore (v)
```

### Run-time of DFS

First for-loop: $O(|V|)$ time

Second for-loop:
- ```explore(u)``` is called exactly once for each vertex u (this may be a recursive call)
- time spent for ```explore(u)```, excluding recursive calls is $O(1 + degree(u))$

Total time: $O (|V| + \sum_{u \in V}(1+ \mathrm{degree}(u))) = O(|V| + |V| + 2|E|) = O(|V| + |E|)$
