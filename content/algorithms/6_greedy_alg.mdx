A **greedy algorithm** arrives at a solution by making a sequence of choices, each of which simply looks the best at the moment. The hope is that locally-optimal choices will lead to a globally-optimal solution.

# Making Change

```py
def MakingChange(x):
    Coins = {5, 10, 25, 100, 200}
    Sum = 0
    while Sum != x:
        Let c in Coins be the largest denomination such that Sum + c <= x
        if there is no such denomination:
            return "No Solution"
        Add c to the change that will be returned
        Sum = Sum + c
```

# The 0, 1 - Knapsack Problem

Find a greedy algorithm to solve the following problem.

input:
- $n$ objects such that object $i$ (1 \leq i \leq n) has a positive value $v_i$ and a positive weight $w_i$.
- A maximum weight $W$.

output: A vector $X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ such that
- $0 \leq x_i \leq 1$
- The total value $x_1v_1+x_2v_2+ ... + x_nv_n$ is maximized.
- The total weight is not too heavy: $x_1w_1 + x_2w_2 + ... + x_nw_n \leq W$.

## Lemma 

If the objects are selected in order of decreasing $\frac{v_i}{w_i}$, then the greedy choice finds an optimal solution.

## Algorithm

1. Compute all the $\frac{v_i}{w_i}$
2. Sort the objects in decreasing order of $\frac{v_i}{w_i}$ (use MergeSort)
3. Build the solution by applying the greedy choice with respect to decreasing order of $\frac{v_i}{w_i}$.

Total time: $O(n log(n))$

# Minimum Spanning Tree

We are given edge $G = (V, E)$ that is undirected and connected. Each edge ${u, v} \in \E$ has a weight $wt (u, v)$. 

We want a compute a subgraph $G' of G$ such that:
- The vertex set of $G' is V$, 
- $G'$ is connected, 
- and $weight(G')$ is minimum, where
    - $weight(G')$ = sum of weights of edges in $G'$.

$G'$ is called a **Minimum Spanning Tree** of G (MST of G).

## Lemma

Let $G = (V, E) be an undirected and connected graph, where each edge ${u,v} \in E$ has a weight $wt(u,v)$.

Split $V$ into $A$ and $B$. Let ${u,v} \in E$ be a shortest edge connecting $A$ and $B$. then there is an MST of $G$ that contains ${u,v}$.

From the previous lemma, any algorithm that follows this greedy scheme is guaranteed to work:
1. X = {}
2. Repeat until $|X| = |V| - 1$
    - Pick a set $S$ such that $X$ has no edge between $S$ and $V\S$.
    - Let $e \in E$ be a minimum-weight edge between $S$ and $V\S$.
    - $X = X \cup {e}$

## Union-Find Data Structure

Before presenting a first algorithm to compute an MST, we first open a parenthesis and study a data structure called *Union-find*.

Given $n$ sets, each of size one, process a sequence of operation, where each operation is one of:

```py
def union (A,B,C):
    Set C = A U B
    A = {}
    B = {}

def find (x):
    Return the name of the set that contains x
```

The sequence consists of $n-1$ Union operations, $m$ Find operations. This can be done in any arbitrary order.

We store each set in a list:
- the list has a pointer to the head and a pointer to the tail
- the first node stores the name of the set and the size of the set
- each other node stores one element of the set
- each node $u$ stores two pointers:
    - next($u$) the next node in the list
    - back($u$) first node in the list

For the Union Function:
- if size of set $A$ is larger than $B$, append $B$ to $A$. Otherwise append $A$ to $B$.
- running time $O(\mathrm{min}{|A|,|B|}$

For the Find function:
- follow the back pointed from the node storing $x$ to the head of the list and return the name stored at the head.
- $O(1)$

**Total running time**:
- $n-1$ **Union** operations = $O (n \log{n})
- Any sequence of $n-1$ Union operations and $m$ Find operations takes $O(m + n \log{n})$

# Kruskal Algorithm

- **Approach**: Maintain a forest. In each step, add an edge of minimum weight that does not create a cycle.
- **Start**: At the beginning, each vertex is a (trivial) tree.
- **One Iteration**: Combine two trees using an edge of minimum weight

```py
# Input: G = (V,E), where V = {x1, x2, ..., xn} and m = |E|
# Output: A minimum spanning tree of G
def Kruskal(G):
    Sort the edges of E by weight using Merge Sort
    for i in range(n):
        V[i] = x[i]
    T = {}
    for k in range(m):
        Let u[k] and v[k] be the vertices of e[k]
        Let i be the index such that u[k] is in V[i]
        Let j be the index such that v[k] is in V[j]
        if (i != j):
            V[i] = Vi[i] union V[j]
            V[j] = {}
            T = T union {{u[k], v[k]}}
    return T
```

## Running time
- Sorting: $O(m \log{m})$
- First loop: $O(n)$ time
- Second for loop:
    - Store $T$ in a linked list Total time to maintain this list: $O(n)$ time
    - Store the sets $V_i$ using the Union-Find data structure
    - In this second For-Loop, we do
        - $2m$ Find operations
        - $n-1$ Union operations
    - So in total for the second for loop: $O(n) + O(m + n \log{n})$
- Total running time is **$O(n \log{n})$**
