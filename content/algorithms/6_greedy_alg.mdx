A **greedy algorithm** arrives at a solution by making a sequence of choices, each of which simply looks the best at the moment. The hope is that locally-optimal choices will lead to a globally-optimal solution.

# Making Change

```py
def MakingChange(x):
    Coins = {5, 10, 25, 100, 200}
    Sum = 0
    while Sum != x:
        Let c in Coins be the largest denomination such that Sum + c <= x
        if there is no such denomination:
            return "No Solution"
        Add c to the change that will be returned
        Sum = Sum + c
```

# The [0, 1] - Knapsack Problem

Find a greedy algorithm to solve the following problem.

input:
- $n$ objects such that object $i$ (1 \leq i \leq n) has a positive value $v_i$ and a positive weight $w_i$.
- A maximum weight $W$.

output: A vector $X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ such that
- $0 \leq x_i \leq 1$
- The total value $x_1v_1+x_2v_2+ ... + x_nv_n$ is maximized.
- The total weight is not too heavy: $x_1w_1 + x_2w_2 + ... + x_nw_n \leq W$.

## Lemma 

If the objects are selected in order of decreasing $\frac{v_i}{w_i}$, then the greedy choice finds an optimal solution.

## Algorithm

1. Compute all the $\frac{v_i}{w_i}$
2. Sort the objects in decreasing order of $\frac{v_i}{w_i}$ (use MergeSort)
3. Build the solution by applying the greedy choice with respect to decreasing order of $\frac{v_i}{w_i}$.

Total time: $O(n log(n))$

# Minimum Spanning Tree

We are given edge $G = (V, E)$ that is undirected and connected. Each edge ${u, v} \in \E$ has a weight $wt (u, v)$. 

We want a compute a subgraph $G' of G$ such that:
- The vertex set of $G' is V$, 
- $G'$ is connected, 
- and $weight(G')$ is minimum, where
    - $weight(G')$ = sum of weights of edges in $G'$.

$G'$ is called a **Minimum Spanning Tree** of G (MST of G).
