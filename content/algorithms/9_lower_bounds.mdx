# Adversarial Arguments

## Example 1

We can find the maximum element in an unsorted array in $O(n)$ time. How can we argue that this is optimal?

Idea: Show that any algorithm which executes a number of steps that is "too small" can be fooled by at least one input.

We show that  with only $n-1$ steps, we cannot find the max in the array.

Adversary strategy:
1. When the algorithm asks for the number at position $i$ in $A$, we return 0.
2. We tell the algo: now that you executed your $n-1$ steps, go ahead if you're so smart: tell us what is the max?

So we cannot solve this in at most $n-1$ steps, we need $(n-1) + 1$ steps. Therefore $O(n)$ is optimal.

## Example 2

We can find the median in an array in O(n) time using the selection algorithm. Can we do better?

We will prove that with at most $n-1$ steps no algo can compute the median.

Adversary strategy:
1. When the algo asks for the number at position $i$ in $A$, we return $A[i] = i$.
2. Algo says $A[k]$ is median, but we say that missing value is such a value that $A[k]$ is different

So it takes $\Omega ((n-1) + 1) steps to compute the median.
