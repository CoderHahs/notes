An algorithm has **polynomial running time** if there is a constant $c \geq 1$ such that for every input of length $n$, the algorithm takes $O(n^c)$ time.

An algorithm has **exponential running time** if there is a constant $c \geq 1$ such that for every input of length $n$, the algorithm takes $O(2^{n^c})$ time.

# Complexity Class P

A **decision problem** is a problem for which the answer is "yes" or "no". The **complexity class** $P =$ set of all decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time. For example a sorting problem is not in $P$, since it does not output "yes" or "no".

Examples of problems in $P$:
- is a given input graph connected
- is a given input graph bipartite
- is a given input sequence sorted
- does a given input graph contain an Euler tour? An Euler tour is a path that traverses each edge exactly once

# Other Problems

## Hamiltonian Cycle

- input: An undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ stored using adjacency lists
- question: Does $G$ contain a Hamiltonian cycle? A *Hamiltonian cycle* is a cycle that traverses each vertex exactly once.

Right now on this planet, nobody knows how to solve this problem in polynomial time. Not known if this problem is in $P$!

## Travelling Salesman Problem

- input:
    - A complete directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where each edge $(u,v) \in E$ has a weigh $wt(u,v) > 0$
    - An integer K
- question: Does $G$ contain a Hamiltonian cycle of total weight at most $K$?

Again we don't know if this problem is in $P$!

## Subset-Sum

- input: A set $S$ of integers together with an integer $t$
- question: Is there a subset $S'$ of $S$ such that the sum of the subset is equal to $t$?

Not known if this problem is in $P$!

## Clique

- input: An undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ together with an integer $K$
- question: DOes $G$ contain a clique (complete subgraph) with $K$ vertices?

Not known if this problem is in $P$!

# Proving

For each of the 4 previous problems
- Not know if it can be solved in polynomial time
- If the answer to the question is YES, then
    - there is a "short" proof for this
        - "short" means the length of the proof is "polynomial in the length of the input"
    - if someones gives us such a short proof, then we can "easily" verify this proof
        - here "easily" means "in polynomial time"

How to check if proof is correct?

## Hamiltonian cycle

proof/solution: sequence $v_1, ..., v_k$ of vertices

verification: 
- $k=n$?
- no duplicates in $v_1, ..., v_k$
- For each $1 \leq i < k-1, {v_i, v_{i+1}$ is an edge?
- ${v_k, v_1} is an edge?

## TSP

proof/solution: sequence $v_1, ..., v_k$ of vertices

verification: 
- $k=n$?
- no duplicates in $v_1, ..., v_k$
- Do we have $\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} wt(v_i, v_{i+1}) + wt (v_k, v_1) \leq K$?

## Subset-sum

proof/solution: A set $S'$

verification: 
- is $S'$ a subset of S? 
- Do we have sum of subset $=t$?

## Clique

proof/solution: A set $V'$

verification:
- is $V'$ a subset of V?
- Do we have $|V'| = K$?
- For each $u,v \in V'$ such that $u \neq v$, is ${u,v}$ an edge in $E$?

# Complexity Class NP

A decision problem $A$ is in $NP$ if
- for a given input $I$, the answer to the question $A(I)$ is YES, then there exists a proof/solution/certificate $C$ such that
    - $C$ is short (polynomial size in the length of $I$)
    - in polynomial time, we can verify that $C$ is a correct proof for the fact that $A(I)$ = YES

$NP$ stands for Nondeterministic Polynomial 

# Formal P vs. NP

## Language of a Decision Problem

The *language* of a decision problem is the set of all inputs (encoded as finite strings) for which the answer is YES.

Examples:
- HAM-CYCLE = {$G$ | $G$ is a graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle}
- TSP = {($G, K$) | $G$ is a complete directed graph $G = (V,E)$, where each edge $(u,v) \in E$ has a weight $wt(u,v) > 0$, $K$ is an integer and $G$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle with total weight at most $K$.}
- SUBSET-SUM = {$(S, t) | S$ is a set of integers, $t$ is an integer and $\exists S' \subseteq S$ such that $\sum_{x \in S'} x = t$}

## Complexity Class P

The language $L$ (of a decision problem) is in $P$ if the following is true. There exists an algorithm $A$ and a constant $c \geq 1$ such that for any input $x$, 
- if $x \in L \iff A(x)$ returns YES.
- the running time of $A(x)$ is $O(n^c)$, where $n$ is the length of $x$.

## Complexity Class NP

The language $L$ (of a decision problem) is in $NP$ if the following is true. There exists an algorithm $V$ and a constant $c \geq 1$ such that for any input $x$,
- $x \in L \iff$ there exists a certificate $y$ such that
    - $|y| = O(|x|^c)$
    - $V(x,y)$ returns YES
    - and the running time of $V(x,y)$ is polynomial in the length of $x$.

Observe that $V$ is a verification algorithm. It has 2 input parameters.

### Example: Hamiltonian Cycle

> ${G : G$ is a graph that has a Hamiltonian cycle} is in NP

Verification algorithm V takes as input
- graph $G = (V,E)$, where $n = |v|$
- certificate $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k$

It does the following:
1. check is $k = n$
2. check if $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k$ are all different
3. check if ${v_1, v_2}, {v_2, v_3}, ..., {v_n, v_1}$ are edges in $G$
4. if steps 1-3 were successful, return YES, otherwise NO.

## Theorem

> $P \subseteq NP$

Proof: Let $L$ be an arbitrary language (of a decision problem) in $P$. By definition, there is an algorithm $A$ such that for any input $x$,
- $x \in L \iff A(x)$ returns YES.
- The running time of $A(x)$ is polynomial in the length of x.

We have to show that $L$ is in $NP$. That is, we have to show that $L$ satisfies the definition of $NP$.

Therefore, we need a verification algorithm $V$. We define it in the following way: $V$ takes as input.
- the input $x$ for $A$
- and a certificate $y$

$V(x,y)$ does the following: it runs $A(x)$ and that's it! (It ignores $y$).

We then have the following:
- $x \in L$
    - $\iff A(x)$ returns YES
    - $\iff V(x,$ empty string $y$) returns YES
    - $\iff$ there exists a certificate $y$ such that
        - $|y|$ is polynomial in the length of $x$,
        - $V(x,y)$ returns YES
        - and the running time of $V(x,y)$ is polynomial in the length of $x$.

Therefore $L$ is in NP.

## Big Question

Is $P=NP$ or $P\neqNP$? Most people believe the latter.

If we want to prove that $P\neqNP$, then we have to show that there exists a language $L$ (of a decision problem) such that
- $L \in NP$
- $L \not\in P$.

Such an $L$ must be "difficult". So we should look at the "most difficult" problems.

But what does this mean? How can we measure how difficult a problem is?

# Reductions

## Polynomial-Time Reduction

Let $L$ and $L'$ be two languages. We say that $L$ is a *polynomial-time reducible* to $L'$ if the following is true: there exists a function $f$ which satisfies the following famous 3 properties:
- $f$ maps inputs for $L$ to inputs for $L'$
- for ever input $x$ for $L$, $x \in L \iff f(x) \in L'$
- for every input $x$ for $L$, $f(x)$ can be computed in time that is polynomial in the length of $x$.

Notation: $L \leq_P L'$

## Theorem

If $L \leq_P L'$ and $L' \in P$, then $L \in P$.

Intuition:
- $L' \in P$ means "$L'$ is easy"
- $L \leq_P L'$ means "$L$ is easer than $L'$".
- So $L$ is easy, $L \in P$.

Consider the following algorithm $A$: on input $x$,
- Compute $f(x)$
- Run $A'(f(x))$

We have $x \in L$
- $\iff f(x) \in L'$ by definition of reduction
- $\iff A'(f(x))$ returns YES by definition of $A'$
- $\iff A(x)$ returns YES by definition of $A$

The running time of $A$ is polynomial in the length of $x$. So $L \in P$.

## About 3SAT

Consider a Boolean formula $\phi$ with variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ of the form $\phi = C_1 \land C_2 \land ... \land C_m$, where each $C_i$ is of the form $C_i = l_1^i \lor l^i_2 \lor l^i_3$. Each $l^i_j$ is a variable or the negation of a variable. $C_i$ is called a *clause* and $l_j^i$ is called a *literal*. 

> $phi = (x_1 \lor \neg x_1 \lor \neg x_2) \land (x_2 \lor x_3 \lor x_4) \land (x_1 \lor x_3 \lor \neg x_4) \land (\neg x_1 \lor x_3 \lor \neg x_4)$

We say that $\phi$ is *satisfiable* if there exists a truth value for each $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ such that $\phi$ is true.

> 3SAT = ${\phi | \phi is of the form above and \phi is satisfiable}$

We want to show that 3SAT $\leq_P$ INDEP - SET

Let $\phi$ be an input for 3SAT, $\phi = C_1 \land C_2 \land ... \land C_m$, each clause $C_i$ is the disjunction $(V)$ of 3 literals.

$(G;K)$ is obtained as follows:
- $K=m$(number of clauses)
- $G$ has $3m$ vertices, one vertex for each literal. 
    - For each clause, the literals in this clause form a triangle in $G$.
    - Additionally, there is an edge between any pair of opposite literals.

## Theorem

The relation $\leq_P$ is transitive: $L \leq_P L'$ and $L' \leq_P L'' \r\Rightarrow L \leq_P L''$ 

# NP-Hard and NP-Complete

The language $L$ is $NP$-Hard if
- for all $L' \in NP$, $L' \leq_P L$

The language $L$ of a decision problem is $NP$-Complete if
- $L \in NP$
- and for all $L' \in NP$, $L' \leq_P L$

It is not clear if a $NP$-Complete problem exists.

Intuitively, this means that $L$ belongs to the most difficult problems in $NP$. This what we were looking for in **Formal P vs. NP**.

## Theorem 

Assume that $L$ is $NP$-Complete. Then $L \in P \iff P = NP$.

Intuition:
- If $L \in P, L$ is easy
- $L$ is $NP$-Complete, so $L$ belongs to the most difficult problems in $NP$.
- If the most difficult problem in $NP$ turns out to be easy, then all problems in $NP$ are easy! 

## Theorem

$L$ is $NP$-Complete, $L \leq_P L'$, $L' \in NP \Rightarrow L'$ is $NP$-Complete.

Intuition:
- $L$ is $NP$-Complete, so $L$ belongs to the most difficult problems in $NP$.
- $L'$ is at least as difficult as $L$
- Then $L'$ also belongs to the most difficult problems in $NP$

Here is how to use this theorem; to show that $L'$ is $NP$-Complete,
- Show that $L' \in NP$
- Look for a problem $L$ that is "similar" to $L'$ and that is *known to be* $NP$-Complete
- Show that $L \leq_P L'$.

## CIRCUIT-SAT

input: A Boolean circuit
- Directed acyclic graph, where vertices are gates
- AND-gates and OR-gates have indegree 2
- NOT-gates have indegree 1
- Known input gats have indegree 0 and are labeled TRUE or FALSE
- Unknown gates have indegree 0 and are labeled "?"
- There is one output gate (whose outdegree is 0)

question: is it possible to assign a truth-value to each unknown input gate, such that the output of the circuit is TRUE?

CIRCUIT-SAT = {$B$ | $B$ is a Boolean circuit for which there exist truth values for the unknown input gates such that the output of $B$ is TRUE}

To show that CIRCUIT-SAT is $NP$-Complete, we have to show two things:
1. CIRCUIT-SAT is in $NP$
    - *Certificate:* sequence of truth values for the unknown input gates
    - *Verification:* evaluate the circuit (in topological order)
2. Show that for all $L$ in $NP$, $L \leq_P$ CIRCUIT-SAT
