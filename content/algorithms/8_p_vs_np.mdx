An algorithm has **polynomial running time** if there is a constant $c \geq 1$ such that for every input of length $n$, the algorithm takes $O(n^c)$ time.

An algorithm has **exponential running time** if there is a constant $c \geq 1$ such that for every input of length $n$, the algorithm takes $O(2^{n^c})$ time.

# Complexity Class P

A **decision problem** is a problem for which the answer is "yes" or "no". The **complexity class** $P =$ set of all decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time. For example a sorting problem is not in $P$, since it does not output "yes" or "no".

Examples of problems in $P$:
- is a given input graph connected
- is a given input graph bipartite
- is a given input sequence sorted
- does a given input graph contain an Euler tour? An Euler tour is a path that traverses each edge exactly once
