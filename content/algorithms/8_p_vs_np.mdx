An algorithm has **polynomial running time** if there is a constant $c \geq 1$ such that for every input of length $n$, the algorithm takes $O(n^c)$ time.

An algorithm has **exponential running time** if there is a constant $c \geq 1$ such that for every input of length $n$, the algorithm takes $O(2^{n^c})$ time.

# Complexity Class P

A **decision problem** is a problem for which the answer is "yes" or "no". The **complexity class** $P =$ set of all decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time. For example a sorting problem is not in $P$, since it does not output "yes" or "no".

Examples of problems in $P$:
- is a given input graph connected
- is a given input graph bipartite
- is a given input sequence sorted
- does a given input graph contain an Euler tour? An Euler tour is a path that traverses each edge exactly once

# Other Problems

## Hamiltonian Cycle

- input: An undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ stored using adjacency lists
- question: Does $G$ contain a Hamiltonian cycle? A *Hamiltonian cycle* is a cycle that traverses each vertex exactly once.

Right now on this planet, nobody knows how to solve this problem in polynomial time. Not known if this problem is in $P$!

## Travelling Salesman Problem

- input:
    - A complete directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where each edge $(u,v) \in E$ has a weigh $wt(u,v) > 0$
    - An integer K
- question: Does $G$ contain a Hamiltonian cycle of total weight at most $K$?

Again we don't know if this problem is in $P$!

## Subset-Sum

- input: A set $S$ of integers together with an integer $t$
- question: Is there a subset $S'$ of $S$ such that the sum of the subset is equal to $t$?

Not known if this problem is in $P$!

## Clique

- input: An undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ together with an integer $K$
- question: DOes $G$ contain a clique (complete subgraph) with $K$ vertices?

Not known if this problem is in $P$!

# Proving

For each of the 4 previous problems
- Not know if it can be solved in polynomial time
- If the answer to the question is YES, then
    - there is a "short" proof for this
        - "short" means the length of the proof is "polynomial in the length of the input"
    - if someones gives us such a short proof, then we can "easily" verify this proof
        - here "easily" means "in polynomial time"

How to check if proof is correct?

## Hamiltonian cycle

proof/solution: sequence $v_1, ..., v_k$ of vertices

verification: 
- $k=n$?
- no duplicates in $v_1, ..., v_k$
- For each $1 \leq i < k-1, {v_i, v_{i+1}$ is an edge?
- ${v_k, v_1} is an edge?

## TSP

proof/solution: sequence $v_1, ..., v_k$ of vertices

verification: 
- $k=n$?
- no duplicates in $v_1, ..., v_k$
- Do we have $\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} wt(v_i, v_{i+1}) + wt (v_k, v_1) \leq K$?

## Subset-sum

proof/solution: A set $S'$

verification: 
- is $S'$ a subset of S? 
- Do we have sum of subset $=t$?

## Clique

proof/solution: A set $V'$

verification:
- is $V'$ a subset of V?
- Do we have $|V'| = K$?
- For each $u,v \in V'$ such that $u \neq v$, is ${u,v}$ an edge in $E$?

# Complexity Class NP

A decision problem $A$ is in $NP$ if
- for a given input $I$, the answer to the question $A(I)$ is YES, then there exists a proof/solution/certificate $C$ such that
    - $C$ is short (polynomial size in the length of $I$)
    - in polynomial time, we can verify that $C$ is a correct proof for the fact that $A(I)$ = YES

$NP$ stands for Nondeterministic Polynomial 

# Formal P vs. NP

## Language of a Decision Problem

The *language* of a decision problem is the set of all inputs (encoded as finite strings) for which the answer is YES.

Examples:
- HAM-CYCLE = {$G$ | $G$ is a graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle}
- TSP = {($G, K$) | $G$ is a complete directed graph $G = (V,E)$, where each edge $(u,v) \in E$ has a weight $wt(u,v) > 0$, $K$ is an integer and $G$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle with total weight at most $K$.}
- SUBSET-SUM = {$(S, t) | S$ is a set of integers, $t$ is an integer and $\exists S' \subseteq S$ such that $\sum_{x \in S'} x = t$}
