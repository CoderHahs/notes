# Shortest Acyclic Path
Let $G = (V,E)$ be a directed acyclic graph, where each edge $(u, v)$ has a weight $wt(u, v) > 0$. 

Topological sorting: vertices are numbered $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ such that for each $(v_i, v_j)$, we have $i< j$.

Let $s = v_1$ and $t = v_n$. 

How do we compute the shortest path from $s$ to $t$?

Can we do better than Dijkstra algorithm, using the topological ordering of $G$?

## Step 1: Structure of the Optimal Solution

Let $u_1, u_2, ..., u_k$ be all vertices that have an edge to $t$.

The last edge of the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ is $(u_i, t)$ for some $1 \leq i \leq k$. 

If we know this index $i$, then the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ is equal to **path from $s$ to $u_i$** followed by the edge $(u_i, t)$.

Since we don't know the index $i$, the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ is equal: $\mathrm{min}_{1\leq i \leq k}$ (length of the shortest path from $s$ to $u_i$) + $wt(u_i, t)$. In other words, the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ contains the shortest path from $s$ to one of $u_1, u_2, ..., u_k$.

## Step 2: Set up a Recurrence for the Optimal Solution

For $j = 1,2,..., n$, define $d(v_j) = $ length of a shortest path from $s$ to $v_j$. Since $v_n = t$, we want to compute $d(v_n)$. 

Recurrence:
- $d(v_1) = 0$
- For $2 \leq j \leq n$, $d(v_j) = \mathrm{min}_{(v_i, v_j) \in E} {d(v_i) + wt(v_i, v_j)}$

## Step 3: Solve the Recurrence "Bottom-Up"

**First idea:**
- To compute $d(v_n) = d(t)$, take all edges $(u_1, t), (u_2, t), ..., (u_k, t)$, and recursively compute $d(u_1), d(u_2), ..., d(u_k)$. From this, compute $d(v_n)$ as $d(v_n) = \mathrm{min}_{1\leq i \leq k} {d(u_i) + wt(u_i, t)}$

This is slow and takes $O(2^n)$.

**Better approach:**
```py
d(v1) = 0
for i in range(2, n):
    k = indegree(vj)
    Let u1, u2, ..., uk be all the vertices that have an edge to vj
    d(vj) = infinity
    for i in range(1, k):
        d(vj) = min {d(vj), d(ui) + wt(ui, vj)}
return d(vn)
```

This running time here is $O(|V| + |E|)$.

# Matrix Chain Multiplication

$A: p x q$ matrix, $B: q x r$ matrix, $C = A \cdot B: p x r$ matrix. $C$ has $pr$ entries, each of which can be computed in $O(q)$ time. So $C$ can be computed in $O(pqr)$ time. We define the cost of multiplying $A$ and $B$ to be $pqr$.

In general, 
- $p_0, p_1, ..., p_n$: positive integers
- $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$: matrices such that $A_i$ has $p_{i-1}$ rows and $p_i$ columns.

Compute the best order to compute the product of the matrices by minimizing the total cost.

## Step 1: Structure of the Optimal Solution

Consider the best order to compute $A_iA_{i+1} \cdot ... \cdot A_j$. In the *last* step, we multiply: $(A_i \cdot ... \cdot A_k)$ and (A_{k+1} \cdot ... \cdot A_j), both of which are already computed.

## Step 2: Set Up a Recurrence for the Optimal Solution

For $1\leq i \leq j \leq n$, define $m(i,j)$ = minimum cost to compute $A_i \cdot ... \cdot A_j$.

We want to compute $m(1,n)$.

If we know $k$, then $m(i,j) = m(i,k) + m(k+1, j) + p_{i-1}p_kp_j$.

But we do not know $k$, so try all values of $k$, $i \leq k \leq j-1$ and take the best one. 

Recurrence:
- For $1\leq i \leq n$: $m(i, i) = 0$.
- For $1 \leq i < j \leq n$: $m(i,j) = \mathrm{min}_{i \leq k \leq j-1} m(i,k) + m(k+1, j) + p_{i-1}p_kp_j$

## Step 3: Solve the Recurrence Bottom-Up

Compute, in this order,  
$m(1, 1), m(2, 2), ..., m(n, n)$  
$m(1, 2), m(2, 3), ..., m(n − 1, n)$  
$m(1, 3), m(2, 4), ..., m(n − 2, n)$  
$m(1, 4), m(2, 5), ..., m(n − 3, n)$  
.  
.  
.  
$m(1, n − 1), m(2, n)$  
$m(1, n)$


## Algorithms

```py
for i = 1 to n do
    m(i, i) = 0
    for l = 2 to n do
        // Compute m(1, l), m(2, l + 1), ..., m(n − l + 1, n)
        for i = 1 to n − l + 1 do
            // Compute m(i, i + l − 1)
            j = i + l − 1
            // Compute m(i, j) using the recurrence
            m(i, j) = ∞
            for k = i to j − 1 do
                m(i, j) = min {m(i, j), m(i, k) + m(k + 1, j) + pi−1*pk*pj}
return m(1, n)
```

Running time is $\Theta(n^3)$
