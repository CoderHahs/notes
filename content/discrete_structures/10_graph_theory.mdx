# Definitions

A graph $G$ is made of a set $V$ of vertices (also called *nodes*) together with a set $E$ of edges. We write $G=(V,E)$.

A graph is undirected whenever each of its edges in $E$ is an unordered pair $\{u,v\}$ and $u \neq v$.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. Two vertices $u, v ∈ V$ are said to be adjacent if there is an edge between $u and v$.

An edge $e ∈ E$ is said to be incident to a vertex $u ∈ V$ if one of the two endpoints of $e$ is $u$.

The degree of a vertex $u ∈ V$ is equal to the number of edges incident to $u$.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph. The out-degree of a vertex $u ∈ V$ is equal to the number of edges $e$ such that $u$ is the starting point of $e$.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph. The in-degree of a vertex $u ∈ V$ is equal to the number of edges $e$ such that $u$ is the endpoint of $e$.

> $deg(u) = \mathrm{indeg}(u) + \mathrm{outdeg}(u)$


Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. A path of length greater than zero that begins and ends at the same vertex is called a *cycle*.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph. A (directed) path of length greater than zero that begins and ends at the same vertex is called a (directed) cycle.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph and $u, v ∈ V$ be two vertices. A *path of length k* between $u$ and $v$ is a sequence of vertices.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. We say that $G$ is *connected* if for all vertices $u, v ∈ V$, there is a path between $u$ and $v$.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph and $u, v \in V$ be two vertices. A (directed) path of length $k$ from $u$ to $v$ is a sequence of vertices $x_0, x_1, ..., x_k$ such that $x_0 = u, x_k = v$ and $(x_0, x_1) \in E, (x_1, x_2) \in E, ..., (x_{k-1}, x_k) 
\in E$ 

A graph is *planar* if it can be drawn on a plan such that the edges don't intersect.

A graph with $v$ vertices has at most $v^2$ edges.

# Theorem (Handshaking Lemma)

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph, then $\sum_{u \in V} \mathrm{deg}(u) = 2|E|$.

# Theorem 

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. Then $G$ has an even number of vertices with an odd degree.

# Theorem (Euler's Formula)

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a planar and connected graph.

Let $v = |V|, e = |E|$ and $f$ = the number of faces. Then, $v-e+f = 2$, $e \leq 3v-6$
