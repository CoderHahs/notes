Defining something (function, algorithm, set, etc.) as a function of itself.

# Lame's Theorem

Let $a,b \in \Z$ such that $a \geq b > 0$. Euclid's algorithm performs O $(\log{b})$ divisions.

# Binary Tree 

A **binary tree** is defined recursively by:
- an isolated node $r$ is a binary tree with root r
- Let $T_1$ be a binary tree with root $r_1$
- Let $T_2$ be a binary tree with root $r_2$
- the graph obtained by adding the edges {$r, r_1$} and {$r, r_2$} is a binary tree with root $r$.

Height $h(T)$ of a binary tree $T$:
- $h(T)$ = 0 if $T$ is an isolated node, else $1 +$ max$(h(T_1), h(T_2))$

Size $n(T)$ of a binary tree $T$:
- $n(T)$ = 0 if $T$ is an isolated node, else $1+n(T_1)+n(T_2)$

> $n(T) \leq 2^{h(T) + 1} - 1$

# Recursive Algorithms

## Divide and Conquer Approach
To solve a problem of size $n$:
- divide the problem in sub problems of size < $n$.
- conquer, solve each sub problem recursively.
- combine (merge) the solutions of sub problems to obtain a solution for the original problem.

## General structure

For an input $x$:
```Python
def algo(x):
  if (x == "sufficiently small"):
    // resolve the problem with brute force and resolve the problem
  else:
    // decompose x into sub problems x1, x2, x3, ... , xL
    // do:
    y1 = algo(x1)
    y2 = algo(x2)
    // ...
    y3 = algo(xL)
    // combine y1, y2, ... yL into a solution y for x
    return y
```

# Solving linear recurrence relations

## Linear homogenous recurrence
> $a_n = c_1 \cdot a_{n-1} + c_2 \cdot a_{n-2} + ... + c_k \cdot a_{n-k}$  
> $a_0 = x_0$  
> $a_1 = x_1$  
> ...  
> $a_{k-1} = x_{k-1}$
where $c_i \in \R (1 \leq i \leq k), c_k \neq 0, x_i \in \R (0 \leq i \leq k)$

## Theorem

Let $c_1, c_2 \in \R$. Suppose that $r^2-c_1r-c_2 = 0$ has two distinct roots $r_1$ and $r_2$. Then $a_n$ is a solution of $a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}$, if and only if $a_n = \alpha_1 \cdot r_1^n + \alpha_2 \cdot r_2^n$, where $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are constants.

Let $c_1, c_2 \in \R$. Suppose that $r^2-c_1r-c_2 = 0$ has a single root $r_0$. So $a_n$ is a solution of $a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}$, if and only if $a_n = \alpha_1 \cdot r_0^n + \alpha_2 \cdot n \cdot r_0^n$, where $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are constants.
