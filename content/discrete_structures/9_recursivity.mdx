Defining something (function, algorithm, set, etc.) as a function of itself.

# Lame's Theorem

Let $a,b \in \Z$ such that $a \geq b > 0$. Euclid's algorithm performs O $(\log{b})$ divisions.

# Binary Tree 

A **binary tree** is defined recursively by:
- an isolated node $r$ is a binary tree with root r
- Let $T_1$ be a binary tree with root $r_1$
- Let $T_2$ be a binary tree with root $r_2$
- the graph obtained by adding the edges {$r, r_1$} and {$r, r_2$} is a binary tree with root $r$.

Height $h(T)$ of a binary tree $T$:
- $h(T)$ = 0 if $T$ is an isolated node, else $1 +$ max$(h(T_1), h(T_2))$

Size $n(T)$ of a binary tree $T$:
- $n(T)$ = 0 if $T$ is an isolated node, else $1+n(T_1)+n(T_2)$

> $n(T) \leq 2^{h(T) + 1} - 1$

# Recursive Algorithms

## Divide and Conquer Approach
To solve a problem of size $n$:
- divide the problem in sub problems of size < $n$.
- conquer, solve each sub problem recursively.
- combine (merge) the solutions of sub problems to obtain a solution for the original problem.

## General structure

For an input $x$:
```Python
def algo(x):
  if (x == "sufficiently small"):
    // resolve the problem with brute force and resolve the problem
  else:
    // decompose x into sub problems x1, x2, x3, ... , xL
    // do:
    y1 = algo(x1)
    y2 = algo(x2)
    // ...
    y3 = algo(xL)
    // combine y1, y2, ... yL into a solution y for x
    return y
```
