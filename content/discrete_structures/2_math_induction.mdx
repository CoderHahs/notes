# Proof by Induction

1. **Base** - Show that $P(0)$ or $P(1)$ or whatever the lowest possible value is.
2. **Induction Hypothesis** - Assume $\forall k P(k)$ is ```true```.
3. **Induction step** - Show $\forall k P(k) \to P(k+1)$

- I really like this type of proof since its really easy to know when it needs to be applied and its pretty much straightforward
