# Scientific Notation

The system of recording very large or very small numbers by using powers of 10.

Ex. nanometer $= 0.000000001 m = 10^{-9}$, kilometer $= 1000 m = 10^3$

# Units of measure

**Lightyear (ly)** - The distance that light travels in the period of one year. Roughly $3*10^8$ m/s.

**Astronomical unit (AU)** Average distance from Earth to the Sun. Roughly $1.5*10^8$ km.

# Basic Definitions

**Planet** - A non-luminous body in orbit around a star, large enough to be spherical and to have cleared its orbital zone of other objects.

**Star** - A globe of gas held together by its own gravity adn supported by internal pressure of its hot gases, which generate energy by nuclear fusion.

**Solar system** - The Sun and its planets, asteroids, comets and so on.

**Galaxy** - A large system of stars, star clusters, gas, dust, and nebulae orbiting a common center of mass.

**Spiral arms** - Long spiral pattern of bright stars, star clusters, gas, and dust. Spiral arms extend from the center to the edge of the disk of spiral galaxies.

# The Scientific Method

How do scientists learn about nature?

- The **scientific method**, the process by which scientists form **hypotheses** and test them against evidence gathered by experiment and observation.
- A **hypothesis** is a suggestion about how nature works, and the evidence is reality.
