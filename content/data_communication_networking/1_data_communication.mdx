# Synchronization

Loss of synchronization:

- in practice two data/digital signals are not equal. The result is that the timing of the receiver may slowly drift relative to the received signal.

Solution:

- data is sent in bit sequences called frames
- the receiving clock is started at the beginning of each bit sequence

Example:

- a frame consists of 11 bits
- assume that the synchronization at the start of the first bit is late at most 10% of $T_B$

Fulfill the following 2 conditions:

$(10+1/2) * T_S + 0.1 * T_B$ and $(10+1/2) * T_S > 10 * T_B$

These are satisfied if: $|\frac{T_S-T_B}{T_B}| < 3.8%$

# Asynchronous Transmission

- timing or synchronization must only be maintained within each character; the receiver has the opportunity to resynchronize at the beginning of each new character
- timing requirements are modest, sender and receiver are synchronized at the beginning of every character (8 bits if ASCII)
  - high overhead
  - overhead $= \mathrm{control_bits}/\mathrm{total_bits}$

# Synchronization Transmission

- In this mode, blocks of characters or bits are transmitted. Each block begins with a preamble and ends with a postamble
- 2 types:

  - character-oriented
  - bit-oriented

- Character-oriented
  - the frame consists of a sequence of characters
  - SYN is a unique bit pattern that signals the receiver the beginning of a book
  - the receiver having detected the beginning of the block reads the information till it finds the postamble
  - the receiver having received the preamble, looks fo extra information regarding the length of the frame
- Bit oriented
  - in this mode, the frame treated as a sequence of bits. Neither data nor control information is interpreted in units of x-bit characters
  - a special bit pattern indicates the beginning of a frame
  - the receiver looks for the occurrence of the flag

## Dealing with presence of errors

- Detect presence of errors (error detection)
- Try to correct them (error correction)
- If no correction have the mechanism to request retransmission (use of Automatic Repeat Request)

# Random Errors

- An error occurs when a bit is altered between transmission and reception
- Random, statistically uniformly spread errors
  - occurrence of an error does not increase the probability that other bits, close to the one in error, while be in error
  - white noise is producing such errors
- For low BER and frames of "reasonable" length, most framers would experience no error or 1 error at most
  - example: BER = $10^6$ and length of frame = 8000 bits
  - probability of receiving a frame correctly > 0.992
  - probability of a frame having a single error = 0.007873
  - probability of having more than 1 error < 0.000127

# Burst Errors

- occurrence of an error having occurred in the sequence, means bits preceding/following the one in error have higher probability than the average bit error probability to be in error
- error strings (clusters of error bits closely located in the sequence) form
- some channel related impairments producing error bursts
  - impulsive noise
  - "slow" fading/shadowing in wireless (relevance of bit rate to average time/distribution channel attenuation remains below certain level)
  - effect greater at higher data rates

# Error detection and control

The objective is to detect and correct errors that occur in the transmission of frames.

## Types of errors

- Lost frame
  - a frame that the receiver does not receive (e.g., because starting/clock extraction is not achieved due to excessive signal attenuation, increased levels of noise..)
- damaged frame
  - a frame that receiver receives, but some of its bits are in error

## Impact of error location
