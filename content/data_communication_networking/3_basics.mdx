# Why we need computer networks

| Application Type       | Example                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Business-to-consumer   | Ordering books on-line                           |
| Business-to-business   | Car manufacturer ordering tires from supplier    |
| Government-to-consumer | Government distributing tax forms electronically |
| Consumer-to-consumer   | Auctioning second-hand products on-line          |
| Peer-to-peer           | File sharing                                     |

# Fundamental Problem of Communication

- Reproduce at one point - either exactly or approximately - a message produced at another point
- Father of Communication Theory: Claude Shannon (MIT Professor)

# Computer networks

- Number of links required
  - Unidirectional links: $n (n-1)$
  - Bidirectional links: $n (n-1) / 2$
  - $n$: number of devices
- need switching nodes

# Communication Tasks

- Transmission system utilization
  - to make efficient use of transmission facilities
- Interfacing
  - compatible physical and electrical characteristics
- Signal Generation
  - generate signals capable of propagating through the transmission medium
- Synchronization
  - receiver should be to determine when a signal begins to arrive and when it ends
- Exchange management
  - establishment of a connection, communication types, amount of data to be sent at one time
- Error detection and correction
  - procedures to make the communication reliable
- Flow control
  - mechanisms required to assure that the source does not overwhelm the destination
- Addressing
  - each computer must be identified
- Routing
  - mechanisms to determine the route to use when transferring data from one point to another
- Recovery
  - mechanisms to recover from fatal errors
- Message Formatting
  - form of the data to be exchanged or transmitted
- Security
  - protect the confidentiality of the transferred information
- Network management
  - oversee the operation of the network

# Types of Communication Networks

Classification according to the way the "information flows" are transported to the users

- Switching Network
  - data are transferred from source to destination through a series of intermediate nodes
- Broadcast Networks
  - there are no intermediate switching nodes
  - all users are connected on the same medium

# Local Area Networks (LANs)

- It expands over small geographic areas (within a building or close-by buildings)
- It is usually owned by the same organization
- the internal data rates are typically much greater than those of WANs
- typically, they make use of broadcast rather than switching
