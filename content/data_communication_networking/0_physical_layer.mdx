# Elements

- The most basic form of communication is between a transmitter and a receiver. Here are some elements in the communication:
  - Source, DTE
  - Transmitter, DCE
  - Transmission, Medium
  - Receiver, DCE
  - Destination, DTE
- DTE is **Data Terminating Equipment(DTE)** and DCE is **Data Circuit Terminating Equipment**

# Continuous signal vs discrete signal

Continuous signal (e.g. speech) which contains various levels of amplitude, also known as a analog signal.

Discrete signal (e.g. binary) contains only specific levels of amplitude, also known as a digital signal.

## Periodic signal

A signal $s(t)$ is periodic if an only if $s(t+T) = s(t)$. Basically if a signal repeats over a fixed period then it is periodic

Example: sine wave,

$s(t) = A \sin (2\pi ft+ \phi)$

where $A$ is amplitude, $f$ is frequency and $\phi$ is phase.

You can use constructive and destructive interference between signals to find different frequency.

## Fourier Series

You can use the following formula to reconstruct a signal between a certain time $T_0$.

> $g(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \cos(n\omega_0t+\phi_n)$
>
> $\omega_0 = 2\pi/T_0$

# Spectrum of signal

- **Spectrum of a signal** is the range of frequencies where it has energy/power content
- **Absolute Bandwidth** is the width of its spectrum
- **Band-limited Signal** is a signal with finite absolute bandwidth
- All band-limited signals expand from negative infinity to positive infinity.
- **Effective Bandwidth** is the area of a spectrum where _most_ of the signal is contained

# Channel capacity

## Nyquist formula

$C = 2W\log_2 (M)$ where

- W = bandwidth in hertz
- M = number of discrete signal levels
- C = theoretical maximum capacity in bits per second

# Signal Impairments

As a signal propagates along a transmission path there is loss, attenuation of signal strength. The solution to this is to compensate the attenuation, we can use devices inserted at various points to "boost" signal's strength (amplifiers).

Impact:

- degrade the signal quality for analog signals
- introduce errors in digital signals (i.e. 0 may be changed to 1 and vice-versa)

Types:

- signal attenuation
- delay distortion
- noise

## Attenuation

- The amplitude of signal decreases with distance over transmission medium. Repeaters and amplifiers are used to restore the signal to its original level
- Attenuation is an increasing function of frequency
- measured in Decibels (dB)

### Decibel

- Gains and losses are expressed in decibels (dB)
  > $N_{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \frac{P_r}{P_t}$
  > where:
- $N_{dB}$ = number of decibels
- $P_r$ = power at destination
- $P_t$ = power at source
- $\log_10$ = logarithm base 10

The decibel is a measure of relative, not absolute difference. For example a loss from 1000 W to 500 W is a loss of 3 dB. Similarly a loss from 10 mW to 5 mW is also a loss of 3 db. A loss of 3 db halves the strength where as a gain of 3 db doubles the strength.

Decibels are useful to determine overall gain or loss in a system. This can be done through addition and subtraction.

## Amplifiers and Repeaters

**Amplify** the received signals (this includes useful signal plus noise). **Repeaters** recover the digital information and retransmit it.

Amplifiers can be used with analog and digital communication systems.

Repeaters can be used with digital communication systems. They make decisions on received signals and decide how to transmit the original signal. Sort of like broken telephone (but these are more accurate).

# Noise

## Thermal noise

This is a type of noise that is always presents because of the thermal agitation in electrons in a conductor.

The amount of thermal noise power in a BW of 1 Hz is given by: $N_0 = kT$, where

- $N_0 =$ noise power density
- $k =$ Boltzmann Constant
- $T =$ temperature in Kelvin

## Intermodulation noise

Occurs when different frequencies are passed through the same non-linear device.

Effect: produces signals at multiples/sums or difference of frequencies of the original signal.

## Crosstalk

Unwanted coupling between signal paths. Example: more than one conversation heard.

## Impulsive noise

Non-continuous noise consisting of irregular pulses or noise spikes of short duration and of relatively high amplitude. This can be caused by external electromagnetic disturbances and faults in the communication system.

# Delay distortion

The speed of propagation of a sinusoidal signal along a transmission line varies with the frequency. For a signal with multiple frequencies, the arrival at the receiver is different.

The effect of delay distortion tends to increase with the size of the signal bandwidth (=> it increases with an increase in transmission rate). The pulses become distorted, spread in time and can spill over to neighboring pulses, make their detection difficult. **Inter-symbol Interference** is the incorrect interpretation of the received signal.

# Atmospheric absorption

Strength of signal falls off because the atmosphere absorbs some of its energy.

Attenuation and delay are greater at higher frequencies, causing distortion.

# Inter-symbol Interference

Inter-symbol interference (ISI) occurs when a pulse spreads out in such a way that it interferes with adjacent at the sample instant.

Example: assume polar NRZ line code. The channel outputs are shown as "smeared" (width $T_b$ becomes $2T_b$) pulses (spreading due to bandlimited channel). Basically the signal doesn't seem that accurate.

## Causes of Impairments

- Reflection, occurs when signal encounters a surface that is large relative to the wavelength of the signal
- Diffraction, occurs at the edge of an impenetrable body that is large compared to wavelength of radio wave
- Scattering, occurs when incoming signal hits an object whose size in the order of the wavelength of the signal or less

# Multipath propagation

- Obstacles reflect signals so that multiples copies of a signal may arrive at the receiver at different and therefore with different phases
- If phases add destructively the signal level declines and vice versa
- even movement of short distances (in the order of $\lambda$) the signal can vary greatly
- also produces ISI

## Solution: Equalizers

Devices that take the original signal and they themselves distort it, and try to correct the signal to the original signal.

# Adaptive Equalization

- Used to compensate the distortion introduced by the channel
- Tries to reverse the unequal response of the channel, both in amplitude and phase, to the frequency components of the transmitted signal
- commonly adaptive in the sense that the channel response is periodically estimated and the equalizer adapts accordingly
- useful to combat ISI
- involves sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms

## Channel capacity without noise

Nyquist formula

> $C = 2W\log_2 M$

where

- $W$ = bandwidth in hertz
- $M$ = number of discrete signal levels
- $C$ = capacity in bits per second

## Channel capacity with noise

Shannon-Hartley formula

> $C = W \log_2 (1+S/N)$

where

- $W$ = bandwidth in hertz
- $S/N$ = signal-to-noise ratio
- $C$ = max theoretical capacity in bits/second

# Digital vs. Analog Transmission

- Digital technology
  - VLSI product became "low cost"
- Data integrity
  - Ex. the use of repeaters guarantees the integrity of the data being transmitted
- Capacity utilization
  - links can be shared (multiplexed effectively)
- Security and privacy
  - encryption techniques can be applied easily to digital data

# Bit rate and baud rate

- Bit rate: number of bits transmitted per second
- Baud rate: number of signal changes per second

Relation:

> bit rate = baud rate $*n$  
> where $n=$ number of bits per change

# Transmission media

Guided transmission media

- coaxial cable
- optical fiber

Wireless transmission
