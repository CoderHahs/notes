# Elements

- The most basic form of communication is between a transmitter and a receiver. Here are some elements in the communication:
  - Source, DTE
  - Transmitter, DCE
  - Transmission, Medium
  - Receiver, DCE
  - Destination, DTE
- DTE is **Data Terminating Equipment(DTE)** and DCE is **Data Circuit Terminating Equipment**

# Continuous signal vs discrete signal

Continuous signal (e.g. speech) which contains various levels of amplitude, also known as a analog signal.

Discrete signal (e.g. binary) contains only specific levels of amplitude, also known as a digital signal.

## Periodic signal

A signal $s(t)$ is periodic if an only if $s(t+T) = s(t)$. Basically if a signal repeats over a fixed period then it is periodic

Example: sine wave,

$s(t) = A \sin (2\pi ft+ \phi)$

where $A$ is amplitude, $f$ is frequency and $\phi$ is phase.

You can use constructive and destructive interference between signals to find different frequency.

## Fourier Series

You can use the following formula to reconstruct a signal between a certain time $T_0$.

> $g(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \cos(n\omega_0t+\phi_n)$
>
> $\omega_0 = 2\pi/T_0$

# Spectrum of signal

- **Spectrum of a signal** is the range of frequencies where it has energy/power content
- **Absolute Bandwidth** is the width of its spectrum
- **Band-limited Signal** is a signal with finite absolute bandwidth
- All band-limited signals expand from negative infinity to positive infinity.
- **Effective Bandwidth** is the area of a spectrum where _most_ of the signal is contained

# Channel capacity

## Nyquist formula

$C = 2W\log_2 (M)$ where

- W = bandwidth in hertz
- M = number of discrete signal levels
- C = theoretical maximum capacity in bits per second
