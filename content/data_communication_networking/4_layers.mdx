# Communications Model

Source -> Transmitter -> Transmission System -> Receiver -> Destination

- Point to point communication is not usually practical
  - devices are too far apart
  - large set of devices needed
- Solution is a communications network

# Wide Area Network

- Large geographical area
- Rely in part on common carrier circuits
- Enabling technologies
  - Circuit switching
    - dedicated communications path established for duration of the conversation
  - Packet switching
    - data sent out of sequence
    - small chunks of data at a time

# Data Flow

- Simplex, unidirectional
- Half-duplex, bidirectional one-at-a-time
- Full-duplex, bidirectional all the time

# Host vs Node

Every single device that has an IP address and that is able to consume or produce data in the network is called a **host**.

Every device is a node but **intermediate nodes** allow you to transfer and manage data, ex. router, switch, hub, bridge.

# Line configuration

- Point-to-point: physical connections between two hosts shared by two devices only
- Multipoint: physical connections between two or more devices.

# Network Topologies

The arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network.

4 main types: mesh, star, bus, ring.

# Classification of Computer Networks

## Local Area Networks

- smaller scope, building or small campus
- usually owned by same organization as attached devices
- data rates are high
- usually broadcast systems
- Wireless LAN
- uses Bus or Ring broadcast networks

## Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

- uses Junction box, and multiple wires connected to houses in neighborhood

## Wide Area Networks (WAN)

- relations between hosts on LANs and the subnet

# Protocol Architecture

- Protocol: a set of technical rules about how information should be transmitted and received using computers
- task broken into subtasks
- implemented separately in layers in stack
- functions needed in both systems
- peer layers communicate
- two standards
  - OSI reference Model
  - TCP/IP

## Key elements of a Protocol

- Syntax
  - data formats
  - signal levels
- Semantics
  - control information
  - error handling
- Timing
  - speed matching
  - sequencing

## OSI - The Model

- a layer Model
- each layer performs a subset of the required communication functions
- each layer relies on the lower layer to perform more primitive functions
- each layer provides services to the next higher layer
- changes in one layer should not require changes in other layers

## TCP/IP

Has Application, Transport, Network/Internet, Data link and Physical layers

- Physical layer: controls the transmission, encodes data into signals
- Data link: responsible for communication inside the local area network, also responsible for error control
- Network: routing plus sending packets to other networks
- Transport: reliable delivery of data (TCP only)
- Application: suports all the different user applications, ex. HTTPS, MTP, FTP, SSH
