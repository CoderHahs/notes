Input: Sequence $S$ of $n$ numbers and an integer $k$ with $1 \leq k \leq n$.  
Output: The $k$-th smallest element in $S$.

```python
Sort S
return the element at position k
```

Run time $O(n \log (n))$

Here's an algorithm without sorting. Assume that all numbers are different. Assume that there is a constant $0 < \alpha < 1$ such that in *Select (S, p)*, it is always to choose a pivot $p$ satisfying $|S_<| \leq a n$ and $|S_>| \leq a n$

```python
def Select (S, k)
    if |S| = 1:
        return the only element in S
    else
        Choose an element p in S (called the pivot)
        Split S into S_<, S_=, and S_>
        if (k <= |S_<|):
            Run Select(S_<, k)
        elif (k > |S_<| + |S_=|):
            Run Select(S_>, k - |S_<| - |S_=|)
        else:
            return p
```

To find a good pivot $p$:
1. Divide the input scenario in to $\frac{n}{5}$ groups, each of size 5.
2. For $i = 1, 2, ..., n/5$, compute the median of the $i-th$ group, call this median $m_i$.
3. Compute the median $p$ of $m_1, m_2, ..., m_{n/5}$.
4. Run *Select (S, k)* using the $p$ of Step 3 as the pivot.

Time complexity is $T(n) = T(1/5 n) + T(7/10 n) + O(n) = O(n)$
