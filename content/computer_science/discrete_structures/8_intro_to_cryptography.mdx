Let $p,q \in \Z$ be two prime numbers and $M \in \Z$ be a postive integer coprime with $pq$. Then $M^{(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv \pmod{pq}$

# RSA

A large number $n$ where it is of the form $n=pq$, for two prime numbers $p,q$. Moreover gcd$(e, (p-1)(q-1)) = 1$. $e$ is known as the **public key**, which is not a very large number. $n$ and $e$ are both shared between parties and made public. Only the **owner** of $n$ knows $p$ and $q$. For anybody else, it is impossible to calculate. 

Let use consider the case of Eve:  
$n = 2418737527 = 48611 \cdot 49757 = pq$

We want to send her the message *Salut*. The message is therefore represented by the number $M = 1901122120$ 

We compute:
> $C\equiv M^e \pmod{n}$  
> $\equiv 1901122120^{11} \pmod{2418737527}$  
> $\equiv 250061500 \pmod{2418737527}$
and we send $C$ to Eve.

Since Eve knows $p$ and $q$, she also knows $d$ and $t$ such that $d\cdot e - t(p-1)(q-1) = 1$. In her case $d = 159134011$ and $t = 7$. She then computes:

> $C^d\equiv 250061500^{1539134011} \pmod{2418737527)}$  
> $\equiv 1901122120 \pmod{2418737527}$  
> $\equiv M \pmod{2418737527}$

and the message is discovered! The number $d$ is called the **private key**.

In summary, the crypted message is $C \equiv M^e \pmod{n}$. When the receiver gets the message they compute $C^d \pmod{n}$, and the message is result.
