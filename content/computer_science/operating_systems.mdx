# Course Objectives

- **learn basic concepts** and principles behind the design of operating systems
- **get exposed** to the problems operating systems designers face, explore the tradeoffs and solutions to these problems
- **see how are these issues solved in practice** in real operating systems
- **be able to apply these concepts** and techniques in relevant circumstances
- **get some hands-on experience** programming OS type problems (process creation, inter-process-communications, process synchronization, mutual exclusion, deadlock avoidance)

# Detailed List

### Operating Systems overview:
  - interface
  - system calls
  - design and implementation issues
  - OS structure

### Process Management
  - Processes and threads
  - Inter-process communication
  - CPU scheduling - algorithms and criteria
  - Process/thread synchronization - problems and solutions
  - Deadlocks - prevention, avoidance, detection, recovery

### Memory Management
  - Basic main memory management
    - swapping
    - contiguous memory allocation
    - paging
    - segmentation
  - Virtual memory
    - demand paging
    - copy-on-write
    - page replacement
    - allocating kernel memory

### Storage Management and Input/Output
  - File-System interface (files, directories, mounting
    file system, file sharing)
  - File-System implementation
  - Mass-storage structure (disk structure,
    scheduling, management)
  - Swap space management
  - I/O systems (hardware, application I/O interface,
    kernel I/O subsystem)
