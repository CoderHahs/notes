# Real-Time Systems

- the notion of a "system" is central to software engineering
- a system for engineers is an assembly of things interacting together according to a precise relationship for transforming a set of functions called inputs into a set of functions called outputs
- there is no system without interactions, and there is no system with outputs happening before the inputs are manifested
- every real world entity, whether organic or synthetic, can be modeled as a system the condition of transforming inputs in outputs
- in computing systems, the inputs represent digital data collected from hardware devices called **sensors**
- the application has modules which acquire and process the data produced by the input hardware, and deliver it to output devices called **actuators**
- the actuators deliver the output to the process

Example:

- The objective: building a controlled Robot
- requires the design of a computer application whose server,
  runs on a multi threaded CPU under an RTOS (Linux);
- collects data from the robot sensors and stores it (some apps
  use a database), and at the same time calculates the next
  step to be made (by the Robot).
- Sensors:
  - two rotation speed sensors,
  - a GPS sensor
  - two collision sensors (one in the front and one at the back of
    the robot)
  - a real-time streaming camera which sends images to the CPU
    of the robot

# Block Diagrams and Basic Blocks

A block diagram, and the block itself is a conventional representation of a system, system components, and system elements.

Every real world entity can be modeled as a system.

# Input and Output Data: Devices

## Example sensors

- Temperature
- RFID
- Barcode
- Proximity
- Vision
- Gyroscope
- Compass
- Tilt/Acceleration

## Input and Output Devices

Input/Output (I/O) devices usually have some analog or non-electronic component.

Digital logic is used to interact with the CPU.

Devices have different registers to store information.

- Status register: read-only register holding information about current state of the I/O device
- Data register: Read/write register with most recent data passed between CPU and I/O device

## Busy-Wait I/O

It may be necessary to interact with a device frequently to retrieve or send information.

Most basic ways to use devices is busy-wait I/O.

- continuously accessing the I/O device until certain conditions have been met
- continuously checking status register is **polling**

This is necessary when devices are slower than CPU. To avoid inefficient use of processor time, interrupts are used as an alternative.

## Stimuli to Real-Time Systems

### Periodic Stimuli

- inputs which occur at periodic time intervals
- ex. timed events and synchronous communication, a temp. sensor may be polled 10 times per second, consequence: the computer or the OS has to trigger time events in order to poll the transducers

### Aperiodic Stimuli

- inputs which occur at unpredictable times
- ex. asynchronous communication, interrupts and exceptions. A system power failure may trigger an interrupt which must be processed by the system, consequence: the computer or the OS has to react to event and trigger tasks for processing these events.

#### Events

- atomic, non-incorruptible occurrence
- based on communication, time, change of attribute

#### Interrupts

- Signal (or event) used to get immediate attention of processor
- Handled by an interrupt service handler implemented for the specific event that occurred (and potentially others)

#### Exceptions

- occurrence of an error
- exceptions are raised when errors occur and handled by the system accordingly
- e.g. exception handlers (Java)

## Architecture of RTS software

- consists of an operator (human or machine), computer system, and an external object (plant) being controlled
- instrumentation interface: mechanisms used by the system to control the plant
- man machine interface: mechanisms used by the user to interact with the system

# Definition of Real-Time Systems

Many different definitions with similar descriptions

A computer (or processor) based information processing system with the following attributes

1. Must respond to externally generated input within a finite and specified period of time
2. Responses are computer generated signals or actions which commands the external device(s) connected to the computer
3. The correctness of a response depends on the logical result and the time it was delivered a time constraint which not fulfilled leads to severe consequences, including failure.

- Failure for a real-time system to respond on time is as bad as not responding at all

## Definition of Embedded Systems

- Special purpose computer system
- Completely encapsulated by the device it controls
- Specific requirements and performs pre-defined tasks (unlike
  general purpose PC)
- Programmed hardware device
- Combination of hardware and software
  - Facilitates mass production and variety of applications
- Significant growth market

## Domain of Real-Time and Embedded Systems

- discipline where computers are used to control external processes
- RTS automate processes using computer systems
- Processes controlled in timely manner
- Computers act as control devices instead of humans
- Controlling an external process is the feature which distinguished a general computer from a Real-Time or Embedded Processors

## Control and Real-Time Systems

- Real-time systems are used to control external processes (also called a plant or controlled object)
- Closed-loop (feedback) operation is common with real-time systems
- The system has to keep a response (output) signal as close as possible to a desired value (input or prescribed value)
- the system output is brought back to the input, compared with the input and the result (the error signal or simple the error) is used to make a decision about the next appropriate action. This action is called the feedback operation
- The control system will often use the error signal to make a decision about how to manipulate the output
- the error signal is a measure of the difference between the system response as determined by a sensor or transducer (the feedback signal) and the desired response
