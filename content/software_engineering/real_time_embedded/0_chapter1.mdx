# Real-Time Systems

- the notion of a "system" is central to software engineering
- a system for engineers is an assembly of things interacting together according to a precise relationship for transforming a set of functions called inputs into a set of functions called outputs
- there is no system without interactions, and there is no system with outputs happening before the inputs are manifested
- every real world entity, whether organic or synthetic, can be modeled as a system the condition of transforming inputs in outputs
- in computing systems, the inputs represent digital data collected from hardware devices called **sensors**
- the application has modules which acquire and process the data produced by the input hardware, and deliver it to output devices called **actuators**
- the actuators deliver the output to the process

Example:

- The objective: building a controlled Robot
- requires the design of a computer application whose server,
  runs on a multi threaded CPU under an RTOS (Linux);
- collects data from the robot sensors and stores it (some apps
  use a database), and at the same time calculates the next
  step to be made (by the Robot).
- Sensors:
  - two rotation speed sensors,
  - a GPS sensor
  - two collision sensors (one in the front and one at the back of
    the robot)
  - a real-time streaming camera which sends images to the CPU
    of the robot
