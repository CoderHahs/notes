Identify the unique characteristics of real-time and
embedded systems:

- the driving factor in the design is the system
  performance;
- the system comprises sensors (producing
  streams of data),
- actuators (executing commands) the automated
  part of the system called
- the controlled object or the Plant.

- Explain the general architectural structure of a realtime system from a SW point of view;
- Define the unique design problems and challenges
  of real-time systems
- Apply real-time systems design techniques/patterns
  to various software applications (SW).
