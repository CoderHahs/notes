# What is a compiler?

A program that translates an executable program in one language into an executable program in another language.

The structure of a compiler:

- Lexical Analysis
- Syntax Analysis or Parsing
- Semantic Analysis
- Optimization
- Code Generation

Requirements:

- produce correct code (byte code in the case of Java)
- run fast
- output must run fast
- achieve a compile time proportional to the size of the program
- work well with debuggers (absolute must)
- good diagnostics for lexical and syntax errors
- support for cross language calls (checkout Java Native interface if you are interested)

# Natural Language Basics

In a natural language:

- a sentence is a sequence of words
- a word (also called lexeme or lexical unit) is a sequence of characters (possibly a single one)

# Analysis of Sentences:

## Lexical Analysis

Identification of words made up of characters:

- words are classified into several categories
  - articles
  - nouns
  - verbs
  - adjectives
  - prepositions
  - pronouns

First step:

- recognize words
- smallest unit above letters

## Syntax Analysis

- Rules for combining words to form Sentences
- once words are understood, the next step is to understand sentence structure

## Analysis of Meaning

- Difficult to formalize
  - Easily done by humans
  - gives machines a hard time

# Computer Language Processing

In computer (or programming) languages, one speaks about a program (corresponding to a long sentence or paragraph)

- sequence of lexical units or lexemes
- lexical units are sequences or characters

Lexical rules of the language determine what the valid lexical units of the language are:

- there are various lexical categories
  - identifier
  - number
  - character string
  - operator
- lexical categories are also known as tokens

## Lexical Analysis Computer Programs

- Lexical analyzer divided program text into "words" or "tokens"

## Parsing Computer Programs

- syntax rules of the language determine what sequences of lexemes are well-formed programs

- parsing = diagramming sentences

- parsing program expressions are the same

## Semantic Analysis Computer Programs

- meaning of a well-formed program is also called its semantics
- a program can be well-formed but its statements are nonsensical
- once sentence structure is understood, we can try to understand meaning
- but meaning is too hard for compilers
- compilers perform limited analysis to catch inconsistencies
- programming languages define strict rules to avoid such ambiguities
- compilers perform many semantic checks besides variable bindings

Compilers should catch and complain about lexical and syntax errors. Compilers might complain about common semantic errors.

# Abstract View of Compilers

A compiler does the translation in several steps.

1. Source Program
2. Lexical Analyser
3. Syntax Analyser
4. Semantic Analyser
5. Intermediate Code Generator
6. Code Optimizer
7. Code Generator
8. Machine Code

# Formal languages

$\Sigma$: alphabet is a finite set of consisting of all input characters or symbols

$\Sigma*$: closure of the alphabet is the set of all possible strings in $\Sigma$, including the empty string $\epsilon$

A formal language is some specified subset of $\Sigma*$
