# Subprogram-Level Concurrency

A task is a unit of program that can be executed concurrently with other units of the same program. Each task in a program can provide one thread of control.

# Synchronization

A mechanism to control the order in which tasks execute. **Cooperation synchronization** is required between task A and task B when:

- Task A must wait for task B to complete some specific activity before task A can continue execution
- Recall the producer-consumer petri net problem

**Competition synchronization** is required between two tasks when:

- both require the use of some resource that cannot be simultaneously used

# Critical Section

A segment of code, in which the thread may be:

- Changing common variables
- updating a table
- writing to a file
- updating any shared resource

The executions of critical sections by the threads is mutually exclusive in time.

# Task (Thread) States

- New: it has been created, but has not yet begun its execution
- Runnable or ready: it is currently running or is ready to run
- Blocked: it has been running, but its execution was interrupted by one of several different events
- Dead: no longer active in any sense

# Semaphores

**Semaphore** is a technique used to control access to a common resource for multiple tasks.

- it is an object consisting of an integer (counter) and a queue that stores task descriptors

A task that requires access to a critical section needs to "acquire" the semaphore

Two operations are always associated with semaphores. Operation **proberen** is used to acquire a semaphore (meaning to test and decrement the integer), and **verhogen** is used to release it (meaning to increment). Alternatively these operations are called **wait** and **release**.

The value of the counter of a **counting semaphore** can range over an unrestricted domain. The value of the counter for a **binary semaphore** can range only between 0 and 1.

# Deadlock Conditions

- Mutual exclusion: the act of allowing only one task to have access to a dedicated resource
- Hold-and-wait: there must be a task holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional ones that are currently being held by other tasks
- No preemption: the lack of temporary reallocation of resources. Ressources can be released only voluntarily
- Circular waiting: each task involved in the impasse is waiting for another to voluntarily release the resource

## Strategy for handling deadlocks

- Prevention: eliminate one of the necessary conditions
- Avoidance: avoid if the system knows ahead of time the sequence of resource requests associated with each active tasks
- Detection: detect by building directed resource graphs and looking for circles
- Recovery: once detected, it must be untangles and the system returned to normal as quickly as possible
  - task termination
  - resource preemption
