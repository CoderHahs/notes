# Flow Control

- flow control is a technique for assuring that a transmitting station does not overwhelm a receiving station with data
- two flow control mechanisms
  - stop-and-wait
    - also referred as "alternating bit" or "send and wait"
  - sliding window

## Stop and Wait

- source transmits frame
- destination receives frame and replies with acknowledgement (ACK)
- source waits for ACK before sending next
- destination can stop flow by not send ACK
- works well for a few large frames
- stop and wait becomes inadequate if large block of data is split into small frames

### Pros and Cons

- simple
- inefficient use of resources (low utilization, especially for systems with long propagation delays)

## Sliding window

- allows multiple numbered frames to be in transit
- receiver has buffer W long
- transmitter sends up to W frames without ACK
- ACK includes number of next frame expected
- sequence number is bounded by size of field (k)
  - frames are numbered modulo $2^k$
  - giving max window size of up to $2^k - 1$
- receiver can ACK frames without permitting further transmission (Receive Not Ready)
- must send a normal acknowledge to resume
- if have full-duplex link, can piggyback ACKs

## Go back N

- based on sliding window
- if no error, ACK as usual, indicating next frame expected
- use window to control number of outstanding frames
- if error, reply with rejection
  - discard that frame and all future frames until error frame received correctly
  - transmitter must go back and retransmitted that frame and all subsequent frames

- Receiver detects error in frame $i$
- Receiver sens rejection$-i (RRi)$
- Transmitter gets rejection-$i$
- Transmitter transmits frame $i$ and all subsequent frames

- Frame $i$ lost and no additional frame sent
- Receiver gets nothing and returns neither acknowledgement nor rejection
- Transmitter times out and sends acknowledgement frame with $P$ bit set to 1
- Receiver interprets this as command which it acknowledgement with the number of the next frame it expects (frame $i$)
- Transmitter then retransmits frame $i$

- Receiver gets frame $i$ and sends acknowledgement ($i + 1$) which is lost
- Acknowledgements are cumulative, so next acknowledgement ($i+n$) may arrive before transmitter times out on frame $i$
- if transmitter times out, it sends acknowledgement with $P$ bit set as before
- this can be repeated a number of times before a reset procedure is initiated
- NOTE: either damaged or lost, for sender is the same since it can't reconstruct the acknowledgement frame to be able to "read" it

# Error Control

- error control techniques use some or all of these mechanisms
  - Automatic repeat request
    - error detection
    - positive acknowledge
    - retransmission after timeout
    - negative acknowledgement and retransmission
- Some versions of ARQ
  - Stop-and-Wait ARQ
  - Go-back-N ARQ
  - Selective-reject ARQ

# Selective Reject

- also called selective retransmission
- only rejected frames are retransmitted
- subsequent frames are accepted by the receiver and buffered
- minimizes retransmission
- receiver must maintain large enough buffer
- more complex logic in transmitter
- hence less widely used
- saves bandwidth
- useful for satellite links with long propagation delays
