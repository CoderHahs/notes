# Design 

You design to mitigate risks. **Design** is the creative process of transforming a problem into a solution. It's the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces and other characteristics of a system or component and the result of that process.

## Objectives of Design
- Create design representations
- Evaluate construction alternatives
- Assess requirements satisfaction
- Assess feasibility


## Key risks
- understanding problems
- large systems
- team work
- ensuring qualities
- evolution of systems

## Evolution

- cost per line of code increases over time
- productivity per release goes down over time

## Software Design Process

- Solution Postulation
    - problem (requirements, constraints)
        - diversification (enumeration of alternatives)
        - convergence (choice of the alternative that better satisfies requirements)
- Solution representation
- Solution Elaboration

## Design Strategies

- Decompositional
    - break the problem down
- Compositional
    - look at the problem as a whole
- Template-based
    - look for a common pattern

## Representation of Design Decisions
- code
- text
- modelling language

## Why Model?
- Capture Ideas
- Share
- Validate
- Track

## Architectural Design
- addresses architectural significant requirements

# How much design?

## Big Design Up Front (BDUF)
- issues found before implementation
- commits too early
- produces heavy documentation

## Emergent Design
- simpler, just enough design
- adapts to changing requirements
- technical debt (cost)

## Rough Up-Front Design (RUFD)
- avoids issues with BDUF and Emergent Design
- based on good prioritization

# Principles

- Frameworks
- Patterns
- Principles

## Abstraction Principle

- Create abstractions for repeated things
    - Factor in commonalities
    - Abstract out varying parts
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle

## Modularity
- Division in components
    - Cohesion
    - Coupling

## Separation of Concerns
- Allocate different concerns to different modules
    - separation of policy and mechanism
    - separation of interface and implementation
