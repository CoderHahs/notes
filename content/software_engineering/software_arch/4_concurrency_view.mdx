metaTitle: "Concurrency View"
metaDescription: "Topics in Software Design and Architecture"
---

- shows how a system works at runtime as a collaboration of components
- runtime system quality attributes:
    - performance
    - availability
    - reliability
    - scalability
    - integrability

# Elements of the View

- Components
    - processes, threads, clients, servers, services, peers
- Connectors
    - shared memory, remote procedure call, messages, pipe service invocation

# Distributed Programming

- Components distributed over a network
    - client/server
- concurrency
- communication and coordination
- built on top of a basic messaging system
    - sockets

## Sockets

- Operating System communication mechanism
    - part of POSIX specification
    - inter-process communication API
    - Identified by IP/Port
    - Byte Streams Messages

# Distributed Programming

- Abstraction of communication
    - localization
    - communication errors handling
    - repetitive programming
- heterogeneity
- security

## Middle-ware

- Layer between applications and operating systems
    - hides distribution
    - hides heterogeneity
    - high-level API
    - common services

### Middle-Ware Technologies

- Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
- Message Oriented Middle-ware (MOM)
- Distributed Object-Oriented Components
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

#### RPC

- Interface definition language (IDL)
    - specify remote procedures
    - generate stubs and skeletons
    - language heterogeneity
    - evolution, portability

##### IDL Example

- gRPC interface definition
- protocol buffers

```ts
// ProductInfo.proto
syntax = "proto3";
package ecommerce;
service ProductInfo {
 rpc addProduct(Product) returns (ProductID);
 rpc getProduct(ProductID) returns (Product);
}
message Product {
 string id = 1;
 string name = 2;
 string description = 3;
}
message ProductID {
 string value = 1;
}

```

##### Call Semantics

Types of guarantees provided to Caller
- at least once semantics
    ```
    At least once:
    request_received = false
    while not request_received:
        send RPC
        wait for acknowledgement with timeout
        if acknowledgment received and acknowledgement.is_successful:
            request_received = true     
    ```
- at most once semantics 
    ```
    At most once:
    request_sent = false
    while not request_sent:
        send RPC
        request_sent = true
        wait for acknowledgement with timeout
        if acknowledgment received and not acknowledgement.is_successful:
            request_sent = false

    ```

##### RPC Advantages / Disadvantages

- make distributed programming easier
- hides semantic differences between local/remote calls
- coupling related to interfaces

#### Message-Oriented Middleware

- message broker between producers and consumers
- asynchronous messages
- point-to-point -> unicast communication
- publish/subscribe -> broadcast communication

##### RabbitMQ

- open source message oriented Middleware
    - cross-platform, cross-language
    - implements advanced message queuing protocol (AMQP)
        - AMQP is a standard message broker specification
            - interoperability
        - various interaction modes

##### AMQ Model

- private/shared
- durable/temporary
- server-named/client-named

- Direct Exchange
    - point-to-point communication
- Fanout Exchange
    - broadcast communication
- Topic Exchange
    - public-subscribe communication

##### Spring AMQP

- spring support for AMQP
- Springboot starter: spring-boot-starter-amqp
    - autoconfiguration
    - RabbitMQ integration

#### Advantages/Drawbacks of MOM

- lower coupling
- better reliability
- better interoperability

- lower-lever abstraction


#### Distributed Object-Oriented Components

- Evolution of RPC model to Object-Oriented Paradigm
    - Transparent invocation of distributed objects
    - Based on
        - proxy pattern
            - substitute for a component
            - abstract communication
            - location transparency
            - a broker for each host (broker registers to server)
        - broker pattern

### Middle-ware Advantages / Drawbacks

- Speed up development
- software quality (reliability, robustness)
- performance penalty
- must be learned
- vendor lock-in

# Types of communication

## Synchronous communication

Caller is blocked until Callee returns

- behaviour traceability (debugging, understandably)
- tight coupling
- connection overhead
- handling failures is hard
- performance low

## Asynchronous communication

Caller continues work, gets notified

# Component Based Software Engineering

- software development based on assembly of software components
- based on component models
