# Definition

Software architecture is the fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its
design and evolution.

# Importance of Software Architecture

- Inhibits/enables quality attributes
- Helps reasoning about/managing change
- Helps predict system qualities
- Allows communication among Stakeholders
- Carries early design decisions
- Defines constraints on implementation
- Influences the organizational structure
- Enables evolutionary prototyping
- Helps with cost and schedule estimates
- Transferable, reusable model
- Allows the assembly of independent components
- Channels the creativity of developers
- Foundation for training

# Views

## Modules View

- organization as modules and relations
    - subsystems, layers, components, classes
    - decomposition, use, inheritance
- develops, managers concerns
    - modifiability, testability, schedule
- component, package, class diagrams

## Concurrency View

- runtime view of the system
    - processes, threads, services, peers, clients, servers, peers
    -  run with, preempt
    - calls, messages, events, shared memory
- integrators, operators
    - integrity, fault-tolerance, performance
- component, interaction, activity diagrams

## Deployment View
- topology and Deployment
    - physical/virtual nodes
    - physical/virtual links
- system engineers, operators
    - availability, reliability, performance, scalability
- deployment diagrams

# Architecture Process 

- Architectural Requirements Selection
- Architecture Structuring
- Architecture Validation

## Architecture Requirements Selection

### Design Context and Purpose
- Nature of development
- Business Goal

### Quality Attributes
- Measurable properties
- Product Fitness
- Stakeholders needs
- Should be measureable

### Primary Functionality
- Critical to Business Goals
- Main Motivation
- Core Use Cases/Features
- Architecture affects Changes

### Constraints
- Predetermined Decisions
    - Technologies
    - Interoperating Systems
    - Laws, Standards
    - Developers abilities
    - Strict deadlines

### Architectural Concerns
- Need to be considered
    - General concerns
    - Specific concerns
    - Internal Requirements
    - Issues

# Architectural Design Concepts
- Facilitate architecture design 
- realizations of design principles
    - reference architectures
    - patterns
    - frameworks

## Reference architectures
- overall logical structure in a domain
    - reference model
    - patterns/styles

## Architectural Patterns/Styles
- conceptual solutions to recurring design problems in a defined context
    - influences satisfaction architectural drivers
    - specify architectural structures

### Sample categories
- data flow
- independent components
- virtual machines
- data centered
- layered

## Architectural Tactics
- fundamental design technique
    - controls a specific quality attribute

## Frameworks
- concrete reusable realization of architecture elements
    - from patterns, tactics, reference architectures
- full-stack framework
    - covers whole reference architecture
- non-full-stack framework
    - covers specific concerns

# Architecture Validation
- to ensure correctness of an architecture
    - architecture review
    - scenario-based evaluation
    - quantitative evaluation
    - prototype development

# Architectural Drift
- introduction of architectural design decisions in descriptive architecture that are:
    - not included in, encompassed by, or implied by prescriptive architecture
    - but do not violate any of the prescriptive architecture's design decisions

# Architectural Erosion
- introduction of  architectural design decisions in descriptive architecture that
    - violate prescriptive architecture.
