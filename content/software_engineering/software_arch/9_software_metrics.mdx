# Software Metrics

- Measure aspects of process, project, product
    - Indicators
    - Provide insights
- Design Metrics
    - Design assessment tools

## Design Metrics

- evaluate design quality
- evaluate reused implementation
- concentrate testing effort
- select design

# Fan-in

- incoming dependencies
    - Number of external modules that depend on an internal modules
- Afferent Coupling
    - Degree of responsibility
    - the higher the more responsible it is

# Fan-out

- Outgoing dependencies
    - Number of internal modules that depend on an external module
- Efferent Coupling
    - Degree of dependence
    - the higher the more dependent it is

# Instability Factor

- degree of stability of a module
- Instability Factor = Efferent Coupling / (Efferent Coupling + Afferent Coupling)
    - 0 = totally stable
    - 1 = totally unstable

# Stable Dependencies Principle (SDP)

The dependencies between components in a design should be in the direction of stability. A component should only depend upon components that are more stable than it is. Depend only upon components whose Instability metric is lower than yours.

# Abstraction

Degree of abstractness of a module
- Number of abstract classes / number of classes
- 0 = no abstract classes, 1 = all abstract classes

# Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

- A module should be open for extension, but closed for modification
    - Behavior change possible
    - NO modification to module implementation

- Violation of OCP
    - needs to change DataLogger to modify behavior
- satisfies of OCP
    - no change to DataLogger needed to modify behavior

# Stable Abstractions Principle

The abstraction of a package should be proportional to its stability!
- Packages that are maximally stable should be maximally abstract
- Instable packages should be concrete 
- Dependencies in the direction of abstraction

# Main Sequence

Instability should increase as abstraction decreases.

## Distance

- Distance from Main Sequence
    - Balance between Stability and abstractness
        - D = |A + I - 1|
        - 0 = good Balance, 1 is opposite

## Zones of Exclusion

- Zone of pain
    - Highly stable and concrete
    - responsible can't be extended
- Zone of Exclusion
    - Highly instable and abstract
    - No dependents

# Cyclomatic Complexity

- Logical complexity of a routine
    - E number of edges, N number of nodes, P number of predicates
    - C = E-N + 2
    - C = P+1

## Weighted Methods per Class (WMC)

WMC = sum of ci, ci = cyclomatic complexity of each method
- Effort for development, maintenance
- Impact on children 
- Reusability

## Response for a Class (RFC)

- Number of methods potentially executed in a response to a message

RFC = number of methods + number of distinct methods invoked
- Complexity
- Testing effort

## Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM)

- Degree of cohesion and methods in a class
    - Ik set of instance variables used by method k
    - P = {(Ik, Ij)} such that Ik and Ij do not intersect
    - Q = {(Ik, Ij)} such that Ik and Ij do intersect
    - if |P| > |Q| then LCOM = |P| - |Q|
    - else LCOM = 0

- How well methods are related
    - Internal cohesion
    - LCOM > 0 means lack of cohesion

# Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO)

Degree of Class Coupling
- Uses (C) = |distinct classes that use C|
- Used-by(C) = |distinct classes that C use|
- CBO(C) = Uses(C) + Used-by(C)

# Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT)

- max length from root to a class
    - Complexity
    - understandability
    - reuse

## Number of children

- number immediate subclasses as a class
    - reuse
    - misuse of sub-classing
    - testing
