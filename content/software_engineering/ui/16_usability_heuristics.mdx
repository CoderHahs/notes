# Heuristics of Understanding

## Consistency
- A system is easier to learn if similar concepts are expressed in the same way
- consistency makes it easy to transfer prior knowledge to the current situation
- Types of consistency
    - aesthetic / functional
    - internal external

## Familiar language and metaphors
- Speak the language of users
- user words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms
- adapt the language to the target groups: children, elderly people, different cultures

### What is a metaphor in UI design?
- a word or phrase designating an object used in place of another to suggest a resemblance
- the use in an interface of familiar concepts to present more abstract system concepts

## Simple, aesthetic and functional design
- signal to noise ratio:
- not too crowded
- good use of color themes.
- remember that "fonts have moods"
- call the laws of Gestalt for help!

# Heuristics of Action

## Freedom and Control
- favor exploration before commitment
- on an e-commerce site, for example, be able to explore without having to enter a lot of information
- allow undoing different actions
- *the user must feel in control*

## Flexibility and efficiency of use
- adaptability to domain and/or software expertise
    - shortcuts for experts, but complete menus for novices
    - several ways to go somewhere
    - multiple entry points for multiple users
- adaptability to frequency of operations
    - if something is rarely done by an non-experienced users (like setting up a printer), a linear process is more logical
    - if something is frequent, make sure the access is easy and efficient
- proactiveness
    - correct mistakes
        - simple example of "do you mean X?"
    - recommendation system
        - those who bought X also bought Y
    - making suggestions

## Recognition over Recall
- limit the cognitive load
    - WIMP interaction mode
    - avoid codes, and abbreviations
    - do not assume that people will remember options(recall), make sure that the functions and options are clear (recognition) on the screen
    - remember short-term memory limits

# Heuristics of Guidance

## Clear status
- system status: space, process, time
### Space
- in recent years, space limitations are less in effect
- sometimes free portion / paying portion (should mention limits during sign up)
- its good to provide status when the user approaches a limit (or problem), not when its too late

### Process
- completed setup
    - example: Thank you, you did X
- action/next step
    - what is the next step?
    - provide the clear options
- completion
    - show the user that he/she has finished
    - for example, a completed order at checkout

### Time

What is response time?
- time required between users initiating an activity and when the computer presents the results

What is think time?
- the time it takes for the user to think before performing the next action (a.k.a *user response time*)

- over time, users become more and more demanding of computers
- users are looking for quick response systems
- users wat to feel in control
    - slow response time gives control to the computer

- maintain low variability of the response time
    - users become more frustrated if the system sometimes runs slowly
    - explain clearly the variability of the response time
- calculate the expected duration of the delay and provide a dynamic feedback

Guide for the UI according to response time:
- <1 second: show results  
- 1-3 seconds
    - a status indicator like the "spinning circle"
    - progress bar
    - countdown indication
- 3-5 seconds
    - display everything you can, as soon as you can
        - e.g. when starting an application, immediately open a window with a title
- \>5 seconds:
    - announce the delay:
        - before the user selects the action(if possible), warn of the consequence
        - during the execution, indicate how long it would take

## Error Prevention

1. What will happen?
    - use feedback messages to warn users of the potential consequences of their actions
2. Oh.. I do not want to go on... how can I get out here?
    - provide an exit
3. How can I enter this information?
    - add input constraints, or manage an unconstrained field
4. Have I lost everything?
    - use a state backup

## Help
- help at different levels
    - global help (global process)
    - contextual help (on the buttons)
- provide tutorials, unless "walk-up-and-use" application that should be clear without additional documentation
- make access easy for beginners


## Error Recovery
- Human sounding
    - make sure your error message sounds like it was written by a human for a human
- visibility
    - make sure your error message can be easily seen
- clear explanation
    - make sure your error message clearly explains what happened, that it is not encrypted or too vague
- recuperation
    - make sure your error message allows the user to recover and resolve the problem
- humility
    - make sure your error message is humble and does not blame the user
- humor
    - if appropriate, humor could help reduce frustration
