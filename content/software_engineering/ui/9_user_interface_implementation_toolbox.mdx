# Words, WIMP, Widgets

## Words are Everywhere

- Messages, buttons, indicators should use familiar and non-ambiguous language
    - many possible synonyms: quit, exit, bye, logoff, logout
- Specific words, focusing on the exact actions to be performed tend to lead to less confusion and favors recall
    - place vs destination
    - insert vs add
- Still avoid rare words
- Reuse the established vocab that is on the page, or reuse button names in the messages

## WIMP
Stands for Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers. The term GUI is more popular (and more generic)

### Advantages

- Champions the idea of recognition rather than recall (design principle). It is easier for humans to recognize an item in a menu than to remember what it is (as needed at the command prompt)

- Offers a limited selection of commands (rather than infinite if we think of command line) which increases learnability and prevents errors. In contrast the command line allows anything to be written.

## Widgets

A **control element** (sometimes called a control or a widget) in a graphical user interface is an element of interaction, such as a button or a scroll bar.

### Advantages / Disadvantages

- External consistency (builds on existing mental methods)
- Saves development effort
    - Libraries already support most widgets 

- Widgets may constrain designer's thinking

# Structural Patterns

## Center stage pattern

- Put a workspace, or a display in the center of the screen
- Direct attention to the center, for important information or the start of a task
- Surround the display center and secondary controls

## Card stack pattern

- put sections (various tasks) on different panels (or cards)
- used when there is too much information for a single page
- view one card / panel at a time

## Closable panel pattern (Accordion pattern)

- content sections on different panels
- user can open each panel independently

## Movable panel pattern

- content sections, or tools, are on different panels
- the user can reorganize his workspace by moving the panels
- the purpose of each sign must be visible regardless of its position

## Two-panel selector pattern

- two panels (vertical or horizontal seperation)
- a context panel
- a content panel
- easily permits a local and global perspective

# Navigational Patterns

## Breadcrumbs pattern

- shows users where they are in a hierarchical structure and allows to navigate back to higher levels in the hierarchy

## Linear pattern (wizard pattern)

- seperation of a task into a linear sequence of subtask (steps)
- often a sequence of dialogues (or selections)
- be careful not to make this pattern too rigid ... plan the possibility of going back ... 

## Pagination pattern

- show user he/she can go forward and pack among a set of pages. Often used in search results

## Fly-out menu pattern

- a menu is shown when the user is on a selection

## Directory pattern

- become a bit "old-fashioned"
- lets see a directory

## Shortcut pattern

- a shortcut can be offered in a different ways, but the underlying idea is to be able to "jump" directly somewhere
