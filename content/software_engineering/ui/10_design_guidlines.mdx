# Visibility

- can see the state of a device and possible actions
- ex. car controls are positioned in a way that they can be easily found and used
- problems arise when we cannot "see" how to use a device

The UI should help the user always be aware of:
- Current state of the system
- What actions/operations can be done

Encourage recognition over recall
- Recognition: menus, icons (WIMP), visible hints
- Recall: no help ... blank page 

Encourage an understanding of the **local context**:
- clear messages on buttons
- good choice of words in menus

Encourage an understanding of the **global context**:
- linear process: show which step the user is at, and what is left to do
- exploratory process: show how to access different sources of information

# Feedback

- what is it doing now? what action has been performed?
- needs to be immediate and synchronized with user action

The UI should always keep track and display:
- Results of any change previously made
- Errors/problems encountered

Offer informative feedback
- Frequent and minor actions should get modest feedback
- Infrequent or major actions should get substantial feedback (especially if they have security implications)

Avoid distracting the user
- Avoid adding non-important messages or suggest various actions that the user could do

# Affordance

- Perceived and actual properties of an object that give clues to its operation

*Capability of a system to suggests its own usage*

- Use of metaphors
    - an element that looks like a button can be pushed
- Discrete but clear help
    - when a cursor is over a button, it darkens indicating that pressing the mouse now would perform the action
- Words found on input instructions clearly state what needs to be entered

# Mapping

- the notion of association, needed between input and output

Mapping refers to the relationship between the action performed and the result of that action

# Constraints

- restricting the kind of interactions that can take place

Principle to prevent the user from doing inappropriate actions that would lead to errors

The UI should:
- Limit the user's choices to choices leading to correct behavior
- Use guidelines to restrict the types of input

# Consistency

A system is easier to learn if similar concepts ar expressed the same way.

Coherence allows easy transfer of previous knowledge to the current situation

Types of consistency:
- aesthetic/functional
- internal/external

## Aesthetic Consistency

Style and appearance is repeated to enhance recognition ("branding"), and establish an emotional tone

## Functional Consistency

Augment user's learning speed by using known symbols (colors/icons) or clear metaphors.

E.g. symbols go forward/backward/pause when listening to music or lots of other icons.

## Internal consistency

Coherence between the different elements of a same system

Reuse the same colors/fonts/structure from on page to another.
Shows that the system was well-thought

## External consistency

Coherence with various standards. Favors transfer learning.

Use of patterns and components:
- Widgets
- Navigational patterns
- Structural patterns
