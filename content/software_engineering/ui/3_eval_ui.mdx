# Problem Report Monitoring

### Goal 
Allow users encountering a problem while using software to report it to the company

### Implementation
- Users should have a way of submitting complaints, frustrations and suggestions during use
- The submission should be part of the software
- requires realistic use of the system

### Advantages/Disadvantages
- This type of assessment "waits" for problems to arise and does not actively seek them out during the testing phase
- Uncommon (but possibly serious) problems may not be found
- Users will become frustrated with the repition of problems
- Less resources at test time

# Log Analysis

### Goal
Backup(in the background) of the usage data in order to observe user behavior and infer errors in the UI.

### Implementation
- Requires realistic use of the system
- Requires a capture of the operations carried out by the user
- Requires analysis tools to extract from logs:
    - Frequency of use of commands
    - Patterns (sequences) leading to errors
    - Reverse operations (undo), often a sign of problems

### Advantages/Disadvantages
- it is possible to obtain data aimed at improving the UI without having to "disturb" the user
- Privacy is a concern
    - not everyone should be "watched"
- log analysis requires expertise in data science (or related field)
- log storage requires a lot of resources

# Scientific Experiments

### Goal
Follow the scientic method to demonstrate that a property of a user interface would be favorable (or not) to user productivity.

### Implementation
The stages of the scientific process are as follows:
- State an hypothesis to be proven
- Choose the variables to measure
    - Independendent variables (controlled)
    - Dependent variables
- Choose a set of subjects
    - Number should be large enough to obtain statisically significant results
    - Sample should be representation of the overall population
- Perform the experiment 
- Analyze the results
    - Using statistical significance tests
- Decide on actions to take to improve usablity

### Advantages/Disadvantages
- A correct scientific approach is very long and very costly to set up
- Even important results can quickly become obselete with rapidly changing technologies
- More suitable for studies on human behavior and cognitive skills

# User Observation

### Goal
During dedicated session, the software engineer (or other team member) studies users who actively use the UI in order to better understand the problems they encounter during their tasks.

### Implementation
- Schedule observation sessions with users:
    - Environment: in-vivo (their home/workplace) or in in-vitro (bring to a lab/room)
- Define the course of a session by a set of tasks:
    - We give the user a set of tasks to accomplish
    - the user defines his own goals
- Do the observation sessions:
    - "Think aloud" protocol (thinking aloud)
    - Recording of actions (long analysis process thereafter)
- Use video annotation software to segment and label vide sections
    - Allos to return to it later by indexing sections with specific observation

### Advantages/Disadvantages
- The video recording allows a memory of a session, and it is possible to return the user from various angles
- Setting up and analyzing sessions is very expensive
- In-vitro environment might feel constrained, but in-vivo experiments might be difficult to organize
- A good choice of tasks to perform can give a very good idea of the strenghts and weaknesses of the UI in terms of user productiviy for the accomplishment of these tasks

# Surveys

### Goal 
Obtain, using questionnaires, information and feedback from users.

### Implementation

- Design a questionnaire:
    - Decide on the type and content of questions 
        - Open / closed questions
        - What aspects of the UI do we want information about
- Administer the questionnaire
- Analyze the respondents' responses to draw conclusions aimed at improving the UI

### Advantages/Disadvantages

- Useful to obtain statisical data from a large number of users
    - Proper statisical analysis is needed
    - Population sampling might not be obvious to do
- Careful
    - Closed questions are easier to analyze automatically
    - Open questions can reveal more interesting information
    - Difficult to phrase questions well

# Usability Testing

### Goal 
A process to identify whether the UI meets the usability requirements previously established.

### Implementation
*Method*
1. Select key tasks to be evaluated
2. Pic usability metrics
3. Set planned levels of usability
4. Design initial UI using the established usability criteria
5. Evaluate the design using by measuring the usability metrics
6. If usability goal attained, stop.
7. If not, include the user's comment in the redesign. Back to step 4

*Examples of metrics:*

- Time necessary to complete a task
- Percentage of tasks completed per unit of time
- Rate of success versus failure of planned tasks
- Number of times wrong commands are repeated
- Number of times the user canceled an action (undo).
- Nunmber of times the user did not use the expected method to accomplish the task.
- Thinking time required to complete a task. (cognitive load)

### Advantages/Disadvantages
- Compromise less rigid than tradition methods like scientific experimentation, but still using a well-defined methodology
    - Partly engineering
        - design-evaluate-redesign
    - Partly science
        - measuring variables
        - specific methodology
