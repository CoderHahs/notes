# Personas

- it is important to research the user in relation to tasks

## User characterization

### Usage Frequency

This is for a software that is already ready to use.

Three categories of users:
- primary: frequent hands-on
- secondary: occasional or via someone else
- tertiary: affected by its introduction, influence some decisions

### Intrinsic characteristics
- age, gender
- language, culture
- education (reading and math skills)
- physical limits or handicap

### Relation to technology and application domain
- computer experience
- experience in the field
- experience with the application
- motivation, attitude
- emotional reaction

## Personas
- Instead of population as a whole, refine into groups of users, eventually define different "typical" users
- A **persona** is a fictitious character used as a specific representative of a user class

### Advantages
- convenient handle for talking about user classes
- focuses on typical user, rather than extreme
- discourages the common design error of describing what your ideal users should be, rather than what they actually are
- encourages empathy

### Disadvantages
- may be misleading
- stereotype trap

# Environments

- Task-Based Model will take the environment into account as an aspect that could impact user productivity

## Environment Characterization 

- Physical location
    - Where is the user located?
- Body Position
    - How is the user positioned?
- Surroundings
    - cleanliness
    - danger
    - privacy
    - level of distraction
    - noise level
- Access to help
    - access to family members
    - community
    - isolation

# Goals and tasks

A **goal** is what we want to achieve or the state we want to reach, without it being in terms of operations linked to a computer tool.

A **task** is a specific step in connection with achieve a goal.

## Tasks and subtasks

The idea that a task can also have sub-tasks. Each goal has tasks and those tasks could have sub-tasks.

For example:
When ordering food and making a payment, you can have a subtask of inputting payment info and entering address as a subtask

You can also reuse subtasks if they are similar between two tasks. Looking for common tasks will help create a good ui.

A **page-based design** is not a task-based design

# Steps to Follow

1. Determine user groups or Personas
2. Create a set of goals for each persona, as well as a typical environment in which they would try to accomplish these goals
3. For each persona/goal:
    - Create a list of all task the user needs to execute
4. Gather all tasks:
    - See if some tasks definer for different personas are actually the same
        - Merge/Reduce
5. Characterize each task:
    - Frequency of the task?
    - What are the time constraints for the task?
    - How is the task learned?
    - What can go wrong?
    - What are the preconditions to performing the task?
6. Further understand and refine each task ,and put it in relation to other tasks:
    - timeline (scenario) - Temporal relation of a task to other tasks
    - hierarchy of subtask - Subdivision of a task into sub-tasks

## Common Errors
- Wrong point of view: thinking from the system's point of view
    - System: notify user about appointment
    - User: Get a notification about appointment
- Think too soon about feasibility:
    - Trade-offs between users and goals and implementation feasibility maybe inevitable, but do not yet consider them...
- Thinking too early about design vision
    - For example: system will display a reminder popup window one day ahead of an appointment (perhaps after persona analysis we realize this will not be useful)
