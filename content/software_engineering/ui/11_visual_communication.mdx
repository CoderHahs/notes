# Visual communication at the core of UI Design

1. Color
    - Use no more than five colors in a single layout. Color should be used sparingly to highlight important information
2. Typography
    - All fonts should be legible and appropriate for the communication style
3. Layout
    - Present content in a way that guides readers through in a logical hierarchy. 
    - Aligning the elements in a layout with each other will help maintain consistency.
4. Callouts
    - Use callouts sparingly to hight only key information
5. Space
    - keep significant negative space. When too much information is in a layout, messaging becomes cluttered and incoherent.
6. Illustration
    - illustration should match tone and subject matter. Only include if it enhances the content.
7. Iconography
    - icons should be simple, easy to understand and universal; they're meant to enhance comprehension, never distract.
8. Data
    - don't overwhelm the reader with multiple graphs of single data points when one combine will suffice
9. Proportion
    - the eye can be deceiving; make sure items are appropriately sized in data visualizations so as not to skew data.
10. Simplicity
    - avoid unnecessary design, including 3D charts, ornamental illustration or extraneous elements.

# UI vs. UX

UI focuses on:
- visual design
- colors
- graphic design
- layouts
- typography

UX focuses on:
- interactive design
- wireframes & prototypes
- information architect
- user research
- scenarios

# Colors

## Components of Colors 

- Hue - Position of the colour in the spectrum, 
- Saturation - Purity of the colour
- Value - Amount of light intensity. Measure of how bright a colour is. 

## Color design guidelines

- Draw attention or highlight items.
    - helps in searching tasks
    - helps in promoting elements for sale
- Communicative organization and relationship
    - which items go together
- indicate state
    - which elements are ready

Use colors sparingly:
- colors can be distracting if not used properly
- if used for information association (coding), then provide a legend

## Use of themes 

Use a limited number of colors:
- use 2-4 colours for normal application
- assign a color to a meaning (consistently)
- idea promoted by the use of themes

Consider the background/foreground relationships
- foreground and background should contrast in hue, saturation and brightness

- helps focus on clarity not based on colours
- remember that some people are colour blind

# Typography and Fonts

Typography refers to the different types of composition and printing, process using various embossed characters and shapes, as well as **the art of using different types of characters for aesthetic and practical purposes**.

Fonts have moods.

## Purpose

What we can express using different fonts:
- mood (happy, serious, old-fashioned, etc)
- importance
- organization of material
    - typed input vs instructions vs headings

## Guidelines
- limit the number of fonts and styles in any screen to 2 or 3
- give a consistent meaning to each font and size
- avoid fancy fonts for informative content
- avoid tiny fonts/ ensure proper text size is used
- ensure text is legible across platforms
