# Sketches

## Definition

A sketch is a quick prototype, made on paper, to illustrate the first design ideas.

## Importance
Probably the most important design technique to quickly propose several alternative ideas.

## Medium
Use of media different from the final media (e.g. paper, cardboard)

## Approach
- Drawing ... doesn't require too much talent
- (if possible) do the group design:
    - each for themselves followed by exchanges
    - exchanges from the start + common design

## Advantages
- Quick to build
    - sketching is much faster than programming
- Easier to change
    - easy to make changes between user tests or even during a user tests
    - no code investment
- Focuses the attention on the big picture
    - designer doesn't waste time on details
    - customer makes more creative suggestions
- Non-programmers can help

## Characteristic
- Coverage
    - Targeted features
    - Approximate layout (display elements)
    - User input (constraints)
    - System output (structure)
    - No data
- Medium and tools
    - Paper 
- Horizontal / Vertical
    - Horizontal
- Fidelity level
    - Low

# Wireframes

A wireframe is a refined on computer media of a paper sketch

## Importance

In the models, details not considered in the sketch are added (font, spacing, colors, ...) allowing a better appreciation of the rendering

## Medium
- Computers

## Approaches
Use of drawing tools or specialized tools to make wireframes

## Characteristic
- Coverage
    - Target features
    - Realistic layout (display elements)
    - User input (constraints)
    - System output (structure)
    - no data
- Medium and tools used
    - computer drawing tool (or special wirefram tool)
- Horizontal / Vertical
    - Horizontal
- Fidelity
    - Medium

# Interactive High-Fidelity Prototype

Very realistic prototype, allowing the user to interact with the system.

- Structure is present with a high resolution
    - Realistic "look and feel"
    - Screen layout is complete
    - Colors, fonts, icons present
- Navigation is present
    - Users can go through all planned tasks
- Error control/prevention
    - Clear messages or input constraints for error prevention
    - Users know what state they are in at all times
- Usability Satisfaction
    - Definition of usability goals + tests
- Software Simulation
    - with limited back-end (canned answers)
- horizontal and vertical prototyping

## Characteristic
- Coverage
    - All features
    - Exact layout (display elements)
    - User input (constraints)
    - System output (structure)
    - real data (or at least similar in scope)
    - Help / Error capture
- Medium and Tools used
    - Programming language
- Horizontal / Vertical
    - Both horizontal and vertical
- Fidelity 
    - High
