# Interviews

An **interview** is a structured conversation in which one or more participants (interviewers) ask questions while one or more other participants (interviewees) answers them. 

## Objectives and Process

Three main objectives:
- Discover information from interviewees
- Record information to be used as input for requirement analysis and modeling
- Reassure interviewees that their understanding of the topic has been explored, listened to and valued

Process:
- Before: Planning and Prep
- During: Interview session
- After: Consolidation of information
- After: Follow-up

## Before Interviews

### Planning and Preparation

- Set objectives for the interview
    - scope? domain? processes? problems? needs? success criteria?
    - asking what your requirements are is too direct
- Acquire background knowledge of the subject matter to conduct an effective interview
    - about the domain (vocabulary, problems) but also about the interviewee (work tasks, role, expertise, attitude)
- Choose your stakeholders carefully
    - Diversity! Time and expertise are also limited.
- Organize an effective interview environment
    - how will notes be taken, written, audio

### Preparation of Questions

- Prepare questions in advance
    - In line with the objectives
    - Improves the effectiveness of the session, which is limited in time
    - Gives stakeholders the impression that they are not wasting their time talking to you (and ensures they are actually not wasting their time!)
- No need to structure everything in advance
    - ~1 high-level question, with sub-questions, every 5 minutes
    - However, be comfortable enough to ask more specific questions that follow up on previous answers
    - Not all questions need to be asked; prioritize dynamically throughout the discussion!
- Open-ended questions, to improve your understanding
    - Of the domain
        - How many SEG3904 projects are there typically in a semester?
    - Of the process 
        - What must you do in order to approve a project and enter the final grade?
    - Of the problem
        - What takes you the most time? 
        - What bothers you the most? What is repetitive?
- Closed questions for confirmations
    - Should the system immediately cover all project courses of EECS? Of the Faculty? Of the University?
- Do not forget “why” questions?
    - Understanding the rationale allows for innovation in potential solutions, not just local improvements

## During Interviews - Session

- Make the interviewee(s) comfortable and confident
    - Introduce yourselves and your objectives
    - Listen, adjust to your stakeholders
    - Demonstrate empathy and understanding
    - Communicate the value of this exercise to the stakeholders 
    - Create excitement!
- You have your objectives
    - Balance tenacity with flexibility 
- Consider interviewing several people at once 
    - Creates synergy! This would allow the stakeholders to comment and add to the comments of others.
    - The response of the small group may be better than the sum of the individual responses
- Potential questions to consider
- Are there any other questions I should ask you?
- Is there someone else I should talk to?
- Do you have any questions?
- Always give participants a chance to ask their own questions!

### Common Mistakes
- Implicit interview objectives
- Poorly formulated questions (vague, too technical, long)
- Questions ordering (technical at first, without summary)
- Missing questions to cover objectives
- Interactions (unnatural style, no empathic connection)
- Lack of knowledge and confidence
- Ambiguity not leveraged/clarified
- Non-functional requirements not elicited
- Interrogatory-like interviews

## After Interviews

Revise and complete the elicitation notes after the interview
    - Needs to be done soon after because one forgets the details!
- Identify inconsistencies and address them in another interview 
    - Or by email, as a quick confirmation in the follow-up
- Keep all diagrams, charts, and models created during the discussions
- You are learning, so be precise
    - Pay attention to the terminology; try using the stakeholder’s
    - Identify synonyms, and choose one term per concept
    - Create a glossary if necessary
- Thank the participants (e.g., by e-mail)
    - For their time and the knowledge they shared
    - Keep the door open for future communications
- Perhaps take the opportunity to ask 1-2 short questions for clarification or confirmation

# User Stories


- Sentence, in a simple business language, that describes a functionality to support (Who? What? Why?)
- Often from the viewpoint of the user or client
- Popular in agile development approaches
- Generic pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story):
    - As a *who/role*,I want *what/desire* [so that *why/benefit*]
- Examples:
    - As a user, I want to be able to search for my customers by their first and last names so that I can find them quickly when I receive a call from them.
    - As a senior manager, I want to produce a report to identify departments that need to improve their productivity.

## Invest Characteristics


- I – Independent. We want to be able to move stories around, taking into account their relative priority. This means stories are easiest to work with when they are independent.
- N – Negotiable. Stories are not an explicit commitment to produce certain features, but a framework for ultimately defining what to produce for the end user.
- V – Valuable. A story needs to be valuable to the end user. Development issues should be framed in a way that illustrate why the end user would perceive them as important.
- E – Estimable. We want stories to be estimable, otherwise they're never likely to be tasked for development.
- S – Small. It is harder to evaluate or plan long stories. When planning the iteration, it must be possible to design, code and test the story within the iteration.
- T – Testable. Document the acceptance criteria, or the definition of what “accomplished” means for the story, which will lead to test cases.

## Negative User Stories

- As a *hostile agent* I want to *what* [in order to *why/benefit*] [and harm *who*]
- Examples
    - As a competitor, I want to be able to flood the system with unnecessary queries to convince users that my system is more performant.
    - As a hacker, I want to be able to steal a user’s password in order to copy their personal data and harm the owners of the system.
    - As a hacker, I want to be able to insert executable code in a system query in order to take control of the server.
- Leads to useful countermeasures 
    - Like a chess game! But when should we stop?

## Summary 


- Benefits of use cases / user stories
    - All stakeholders can understand them
    - Often reflect essential stakeholder requirements
    - Often represent a gold mine for clarifying requirements
    - Negative user stories help identify safety and security requirements
- Challenges
    - Scalability is sometimes difficult for complex systems
    - Weak support for non-functional concerns and for story maintainability
    - Are stakeholders really writing their own stories?
    - Going too far with negative stories could lead to premature design
