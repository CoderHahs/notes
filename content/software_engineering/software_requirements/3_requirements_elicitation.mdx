Requirements elicitation is “the process of discovering the requirements for a system by communicating with customers, system users and others who have a stake in the system development”

# Goals

- Determine information needed, the sources of information & the appropriate techniques
- Get information on domain, problem, constraints
- Produce a first draft
  - Mainly user requirements and elicitation notes
  - Potentially incomplete, disorganized, inconsistent
  - But we must start somewhere!
  - In terms of the IEEE 29148 standard, can lead to the Stakeholder Requirements Specification

# Risks and Challenges

- Problems of scope
- System boundaries inadequately defined or defined too soon
- Unnecessary technical details
- Problems of understanding
  - Stakeholder not sure of what is needed
  - Stakeholder has trouble communicating needs
  - Stakeholder does not understand capabilities and limitation of computing environment
    - Requirements limited by what stakeholders think is possible
  - Stakeholder does not have full understanding of domain
  - Stakeholders state conflicting requirements
    - Hard to detect, negotiate, and prioritize
- Problems of volatility
  - Stakeholders will change their mind and avoid committing
- Other typical issues
  - Experts seldom available
  - Many stakeholders lack motivation or resist to change
  - Finding an adequate level of precision/detail
  - Mixing requirements with design
  - Common vocabulary often missing
- Requirements do not fall from the sky!
  - Sometimes hidden
  - Sometimes too obvious, implicit, ordinary...
  - Assume == “a\*\*” of “u” and “me”
- Need for creative thinking in order to produce innovative and adequate requirements

# Sources of Requirements and Stakeholders

- Various stakeholders
  - Clients, customers, users (past and future), buyers, managers, domain experts, developers, marketing and QA people, lawyers, people involved in related systems, anyone who can bring added value!
- Pre-existing systems
  - Not necessarily software systems, e.g., manual workflows
- Pre-existing documentation
- Competing systems
- Documentation about interfacing systems
- Private data (companies) and public data (social media)
- Standards, policies, collective agreements, legislation

# Stakeholder

## Customer/Client

Person who pays for the software development

- Ultimately, has the final word on what the product will be
- For an internal product, the client is probably a product manager
- For the consumer market, the customer may be the marketing department

## Buyer

Person who pays for the software once it is developed

- Possibly a user or a business owner buying a product for his employees
- What features is he willing to pay for?
- Which features are trivial or excessive?
- Must participate actively in the project (or have a representative)

## User

User of the current system or future system

- Experts of the current system: indicate which functions to maintain or improve
- Experts of competitors’ products: suggestions on designing a superior product
- May have special needs or requirements
  - Usability, training, online help ...
- Do not neglect interest groups
  - Expert users, or with disabilities or handicaps
- Select users with care
  - Different seniority and other categories
  - Must speak with authority and be responsible and motivated

## Domain Expert

Expert who knows the work involved

- Familiar with the problem that the software must solve. For example:
  - Financial expert for finance management software
  - Aeronautical engineers for air navigation systems
  - Meteorologist for weather forecasting system, etc...
- Also knows the environment in which the product will be used

## Software Engineer

Expert who knows the technology and process

- Determines if the project is technically and economically feasible
- Specifically estimates the cost and time of product development
- Educates the buyer/client on the latest and innovative hardware or software, and recommends new features that will benefit from these technologies

## Others

- Inspector
  - An expert in governmental rules and safety relevant to the project
  - Examples: safety inspectors, auditors (e.g., “Big Four”), technical inspectors, government inspectors
- Market research specialist
  - Can play the role of the customer if the software is developed for the general public
  - Expert who has studied the market to determine trends and potential needs of (future) customers
- Lawyer
  - Familiar with laws and legal/contractual aspects
  - Standards relevant to the project
- Expert on interacting systems
  - Knows the interfaces of the (external) interacting systems
  - May be interested in product features (if the product can help the interacting system to perform its tasks)
- Managers and decision-makers
- Others that bring added value
  - People who will use your product as a basic building block
  - User experience (UX) expert, negative stakeholders (competitor, hacker, ...), regulators, unions, testers, interest groups, the “crowd”, etc.

# Personas

- Fictitious representation of a probable user
  - Away from outlier and unlikely cases
- Seeks to represent the needs and characteristics of different groups of users (often unavailable)
- Ideally created from real data / encounters / observations
- Can partially compensate for the physical absence of users
  - Name and photo! Personalizes a particular user. Focus and empathy!
  - No interactions however ...
- Describes: behavior patterns, objectives, problems, abilities, attitudes, environment, culture, demographic info...
- Different templates exist
  - Generic advice: https://bit.ly/3cL4m9m
  - Some focus on particular areas, for example, medical patients (https://russellfaust.com/patient-personas/)

## Characteristics of personas: VARIED

- Vivid
  - The persona should make anyone who reads it feel like they have actually met this person.
- Actionable
  - If the persona does not inform how you sell or build stuff, why bother?
- Real
  - Good personas are not created in cubicles. Go where the persona is and observe!
- Identifiable
  - Make sure you can identify and target these personas, or you will not be able to find a use for them.
- Exact
  - “Everyone” is not your customer. Make sure the personas are distinct so you can apply relevant focus.
- Detailed
  - People are complicated and so good personas are usually substantial

# Requirements Elicitation Tasks

- Planning for the elicitation
  - Why? Who? When? How? Risks?
- During the elicitation
  - Confirm the viability of the project (is it worth it?)
  - Understand the problem from the perspective of each stakeholder
  - Extract the essence of stakeholders’ requirements
  - Invent better ways to do the work of the user
- Following the elicitation
  - Analyse results to understand obtained information
  - Negotiate a coherent set of requirements acceptable by all stakeholders and establish priorities
  - Record results in the requirements specification

Elicitation is incremental

- Driven by information obtained
- You always do a bit of elicitation – analysis – specification – verification at the same time

## Objectives, Strategies & Processes

- Objectives: Why this elicitation?
  - Validate market data
  - Explore usage scenarios
  - Develop a set of requirements, etc..
- Approaches used
  - Often a combination of approaches depending on the types and number of stakeholders
- Expected products
  - Choice of: notes, goals, high-level requirements, scenarios, etc.
  - Generally: disorganized, inconsistent, incomplete
- Extract the essence of the stakeholders' requirements
  - Interpret stakeholders' descriptions of requirements
  - Possibly build models (may be part of your documentation!)
  - Gaps in the model behavior may indicate unknown or ambiguous situations
    - Models help focus our efforts
    - Should be resolved by asking appropriate stakeholders
- Invent better ways to do the user’s work
  - The client/user’s view can be limited by past experiences...
  - Ask why documented requirements so far are desired
  - Brainstorm (or use another creativity technique) to invent and propose requirements the stakeholders have not yet thought of
