# Questionnaires

- A questionnaire is a research instrument consisting of a series of questions for the purpose of gathering information from respondents
    - Questionnaires can be thought of as a kind of written interview 
- A survey is both the set of questions and the process of collecting, aggregating, and analyzing the responses from those questions
    - Surveys can be carried out face to face, by telephone, computer or post
- Questionnaires/surveys provide a relatively cheap, quick and efficient way of obtaining large amounts of information from a large sample of people

## Benefit

- Can reach multiple people in a cost-effective way
- Participants may be anonymous
    - No need to lie, although some answers can be brutal!
- Participation can be asynchronous
    - With answers provided at the convenience of the participant
- Participants to computer-based surveys can be distributed
    - All over the world
- Questionnaires can be quick to answer
- Questionnaires can be repeated
    - To discover trends over time or across populations
- Support qualitative and quantitative analyses

## Challenges

- Preparation time is high!
- Questionnaire mistakes cannot easily be fixed once deployed
- Choice of question types
    - Open-ended (difficult to analyse automatically)
    - Closed, with predetermined answers (lack of flexibility)
- Choice of answers and scales
    - Nominal? Intervals? Likert scale (1-5)? Avoid centralist tendencies!
- Statistical significance during analysis
- Validity of questions (bias, ambiguities)
- Repetition and ordering of questions
- Determining suitable participants to invite (risk of bias/fraud)
- Motivating people to participate and answer everything
    - Wrong incentives (population bias), unattractive presentation, exhaustion...
- Ethical issues (fairness in access, confidentiality...)

## Types of Questions to Consider

- Demographic questions (for classification)
    - Age, country, occupation... For analysis from many angles/dimensions
    - Be minimal! Beware of re-identification risks in anonymous surveys
- Attitudinal questions 
    - What do you think of...? Do you agree with...?
    - Scale with 4-6 values (no neutral) or 5-7 values (with neutral value)
        - Strongly agree
        - Agree somewhat
        - Neither agree nor disagree (Undecided)
        - Disagree somewhat
        - Strongly disagree
- Supplementary open questions (instructive, but qualitative)
- Optional/alternative questions, by population
- Redundant questions, for robustness...

# Prototyping

- A software requirements prototype is a mock-up or partial implementation of a software system
    - Helps developers, users, and customers better understand system requirements
    - Helps clarify and complete requirements
    - Provides early response to “I’ll know it when I’ll see it” attitude
    - Also “I’ll know it when I won’t see it” (completeness)
    - Helps find new functionalities, discuss usability, and establish priorities
- Prototyping is effective in resolving uncertainties early in the development process
    - Focus prototype development on these uncertain parts
    - Encourages user participation and mutual understanding

## Types

- Evolutive: 
    - An initial prototype is designed and refined in several iterative stages to become the final product
    - Goal: to deliver a functional system to the users. This type of development starts with the best understood requirements
- Throw-away: 
    - A more or less faithful prototype is designed to elicit the requirements and is then thrown away
    - Goal: derive/validate system requirements. The process starts with the least understood requirements!
    - The system is designed with another development process

## Techniques

- Prototyping techniques vary greatly depending on the purpose of the prototype (evolutive or throw-away) and the desired level of fidelity:
    - Paper prototypes (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping))
    - Screen mock-ups
    - Interactive prototypes
    - Using animation tools (e.g., PowerPoint with buttons/hyperlinks, [https://proto.io/](https://proto.io/),  [https://app.moqups.com](https://app.moqups.com), ...)
    - Models (executables)
    - Pilot systems
- There is usually a trade-off between cost and fidelity

### Fidelity 

- Fidelity is the extent to which the prototype is real and (especially) reactive
    - Fidelity may vary for throw-away prototypes
- High-fidelity prototypes
    - Applications that “work” – you press a button, and something happens
    - Often involve programming or executable modeling languages
    - Advantages: Provide an understanding of functionality; reduce design risk; more precise verdicts about requirements
    - Disadvantages: Take time to build; more costly to build; sometimes difficult to change; false sense of security (users may hesitate to suggest changes not to disappoint developers); often focuses on details rather than on the goals and important/uncertainty issues
- Low-fidelity prototypes
    - They are static (not operated), without much detail
    - Advantages: Easy and quick to build; cheaper to develop; excellent for interfaces; offers the opportunity to engage users before coding begins; encourage creativity; users will not hesitate to suggest modifications (without being afraid of undoing much developer work)!
    - Disadvantages: May not cover all aspects of interfaces; are not interactive; may seem non-professional in the eyes of some stakeholders (who may not take the exercise seriously)
- Consider showing a low-fidelity, throw-away prototype during you project interview, to get quicker and more valid feedback than with many questions!
