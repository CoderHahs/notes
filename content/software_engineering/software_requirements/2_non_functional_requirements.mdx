# NFR Quantification

- NFRs need to be measurable
    - avoid subjective characterization
- values are not just randomly specified
    - must have a rationale
    - stakeholders must understand goals and trade-offs
- precise numbers are unlikely to be known at the beginning of the requirement process
    - do not slow down your initial elicitation process
    - ensure that quality attributes are identified
    - negotiate/revise more precise values later during the process
- make the desirable direction of values known
    - very few requirements actually need one specific value
    - the video game's frame rate shall be higher or equal to 60 frames per second at least 99% of the time during one game.

We often use measures in a generic way but there is actually a distinction between measures and metrics.

- measure is an observation
- metric is what we are measuring with units
- indicator is metrics with a target and other attributes

# NFR Challenges

These include:
1. Select relevant NFRs that can impact decisions during system development
2. Select relevant metrics (with units) for these NFRs
3. Determine realistic and measurable quantities
4. Assess and specify confidence levels in these qualities

# Performance NFRs: Patterns

# Reliability Metrics

- measure of the degree to which the *system performs* during a request
    - ability to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified period of time
    - very important for critical, continuous or scientific systems
- can be measured using
    - error/defect rate
    - degree of precision/recall for computations
    - Precision = True positives / True positives + False positives -> if positive then for sure positive
    - Recall = true positive / true positive + false negatives -> if negative then for sure negative
    - F1 score = 2 x precision x recall / precision + recall -> average of precision and recall, to do with reliability

# Availability Metrics

- Proportion of time that the system is up and running correctly
- can be calculated based on **Mean-time to failure** (MTTF) and **Mean-Time to Repair**(MTTR)
    - MTTF: Average duration between operation start and failure
    - MTTR: Average duration needed to resume operation after a failure
    - Availability = MTTF / (MTTF + MTTR)
- may lead to architectural requirements
    - redundant components (lower MTTF)
    - modifiability/substitutability of components (lower MTTR)
    - special types of components (e.g. self-diagnostic)

# Maintainability Metrics 

- measure ability to make changes quickly and cost effectively
    - extension with new functionality
    - deleting unwanted capabilities
    - adaptation to new operation environments
    - restructuring (rationalizing, modularizing, optimizing, creating reusable components)
- can be measured in terms of
    - code readability
    - coupling/cohesion metrics, number of anti-patterns
    - mean time to fix a defect, mean time to add new functionality
    - presence, accessibility and usefulness of the documentation

# Testability Metrics

Measure the ability to detect, isolate, and fix defects
- Time to run tests
- Time to setup testing environment (development and execution)
- Probability of visible failure in presence of a defect
- Test coverage (requirements coverage, code coverage...)

May lead to architectural requirements
- Mechanisms for monitoring
- Access points and additional control

Examples
- The delivered system shall include unit tests that ensure a minimum of 80% branch coverage.
- The system development process shall use regression tests allowing for full system retesting in less than 12 hours.

# Portability Metrics

Measure the ability of the system to run under different computing environments
- Hardware, software, OS, languages, versions, combination of these

Can be measured as
- Enumeration of targeted platforms (hardware, OS...)
- Proportion of platform-specific components or functionality
- Mean time to port to a different platform

Example
- No more than 5% of the software code shall be specific to the operating system.

# Usability Metrics

In general, concerns the ease of use by and training of end users. The following more specific aspects can be identified:
- Learnability
    - Proportion of functionalities or tasks mastered after a given training time
- Efficiency
    - Acceptable response time
    - Number of tasks performed or problems resolved in a given time
    - Number of mouse clicks needed to get to information or functionality
- Memorability
    - Number (or ratio) of learned tasks that can still be performed after not using the system for a given time period
- Error avoidance
    - Number of error per time period and user class
- Error handling
    - Mean time to recover from an error and be able to continue the task
- Accessibility
    - Compliance to standards targeting access from people with disabilities
- User satisfaction
    - Satisfaction ratio per class of users; usage ratios
- Examples
    - The hotel management system shall enable at least 80% of users to book a guest within 5 minutes after a 2-hour introduction to the system.
    - The system shall enable novice users to perform *some task X* in less than 15 minutes.
    - The system shall enable expert users to perform *some task X* in less than 2 minutes.
    - The satisfaction level of the system shall be “very good” or better for at least 80% of customers polled after a 3-month usage period.

# Domain-Specific Metrics
The most appropriate quality metrics will vary from one application domain to another, e.g.:
- Performance
    - Web-based system:Number of requests processed per second
    - Video games: Number of 3D image frames per second
- Accessibility
    - Web-based system: Compliance with standards for people with visual disabilities
    - Video games: Handling by a 8-10 year old kid (and, also, no violence!)

# Contemporary qualities

## Security

Requirements expressed in terms of:
- Types of attacks, threats or vulnerabilities
- Risks
- Observed events
- Controls
- Technical solutions (how)
- Individuals!

Security measures the ability of the system to resist unauthorized accesses and other attacks. Some metrics include:
- Minimal success rate in authentication
- Level of resistance to known attacks (to be enumerated)
- Time/effort/resources/probability needed to find a key
- Probability/time/resources needed to detect an attack
- Percentage of useful services still available during an attack
- Percentage of successful attacks
- Lifespan of a password/session
- Encryption level
- Compliance level with security standards or guidelines

Examples of security requirements
- The system shall detect at least 99% of intrusion attempts within 10 seconds
- Under a detected Denial of Service attack, the system shall continue offering service X to its premium users
- The system shall use AES-192 or stronger encryption on the data it stores
- The server shall identify its client applications before allowing them to use its capabilities
- The system shall log access authorization attempts
- The system shall force its users to change their password on their first monthly login

## Safety

Protection against *unintended* threats/hazards
- both types of threats can be internal or external
- similar metrics
    - replace attack with hazard!

## Privacy and Confidentiality

### Privacy 
Privacy refers to an individual's right to be free from intrusion or interference by others. It is a fundamental right in a free and democratic society. Individuals have privacy interests in relation to their bodies, personal information, expressed thoughts and opinions, personal communications with others, and spaces they occupy.

Privacy is often described from the viewpoint of the user
- The system shall enable the user to manage the visibility of their personal information with other users
- The system shall notify users of the system’s information management policy before any personal information is collected from them
- The system shall destroy personal information of a user within 1 year of the deletion of that user’s account

### Confidentiality

The ethical duty of confidentiality refers to the obligation of an individual or organization to safeguard entrusted information. The ethical duty of confidentiality includes obligations to protect information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, loss or theft. 

Confidentiality is often described from the viewpoint of the organization
- The system shall prevent personal information to be accessed by unauthorized users

## Legal (Normative) Compliance

- Many sources of norms
    - Laws, acts, regulations, policies, standards, collective agreements, contracts, codes
    - Mostly expressed in terms of obligations, rights, interdictions...
- There are consequences to non-compliance to applicable norms
    - Fines/penalties, additional audits, licence removal, imprisonment, closure, loss of reputation...
- Yet, it is insufficient to simply cite appropriate norms... 
    - “The system shall comply with the Personal Information Protection and Documents Act (PIPEDA)” does not help much (too coarse-grained)!
        - PDF version (57 pages): https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/P-8.6.pdf
    - Ditto with “The system shall comply with the General Data Protection Regulation” (GDPR, from the European Union)

## Ethical Requirements

Go beyond (imposed) regulatory norms and consider ethics!
- Applied ethics is the use of ethics principles (what is right or good) in actual situations, such as in professional life
- One challenge is to turn ethical considerations and principles into concerns and requirements that engineers can understand

## Values

## Emotional Requirements

“Make sure the new video game is fun!”
- Common in games, social media applications, wellness apps
- Metrics based on intended emotional state of the user/player, the frequency of usage/gaming, the duration of usage/gaming, etc.
- States based on:
- amusement, anger, contempt, contentment,disgust, embarrassment,excitement, fear, guilt, pride in achievement, relief, sadness/distress, satisfaction, sensory pleasure, and shame
