# Types of Requirements

A **goal** is an objective or concern that guides the RE process. It can be used to discover and evaluate functional and non-functional requirements.
- a goal is not yet a requirement
- all requirements must be verifiable

A **functional requirement** is a requirement defining functions of the system under development
- describes what the system should do

A **non-functional requirement (NFR)** is a requirement characterized by a measurable property or quality such as system performance, robustness, usability, maintainability, etc.

A **user requirement** is a desired goal or function that a user or other stakeholder expects the system to achieve.    
- does not necessarily become a system requirement

**Application domain requirements** (sometimes called *business rules*) are requirements derived from business practices within a given industrial sector or company, or defined by government regulations or standards.
- may lead to system requirements. Can be functional or non-functional

**System requirements** are the requirements for the system to be built, as a whole. In a system containing software, **software requirement** are derived from the system requirements.

## Functional Requirements
- what **inputs** should the system accept
- what **outputs** should the system produce
- what data the system should **store** other systems might use
- what **computations** the system should performance
- the **timing** and **synchronization** of the above

> the system shall enable the user to search the database by product

## Non-functional requirements

- if not met, the system is useless
- may be difficult to state precisely and imprecise requirements may be difficult to verify

> The system development process and deliverable documents shall conform to the MIL-STD-498 standards

## Goals
- conveys the intention or the objective of one or many stakeholders
- can guide the discovery of verifiable non-functional requirements that can be tested objectively

> the system must be easy to use by experienced controllers. 


## Application-Domain Requirements
- derived from the application domain
- describe system characteristics and features that reflect the domain
- may be new functional requirements, constraints on existing requirements, or define specific computations
- if domain requirements are not satisfied, the system may be workable

> For a health info system: the system shall comply with Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act
