# Process Concept

A **process** is an instance of a program in execution. Batch systems work in terms of "jobs". Many modern process concepts are still expressed in terms of jobs, (e.g. job scheduling), and the two terms are often used interchangeably.

## The Process

- Process memory is divided into four sections as shown below:
  - The text section comprises the compiled program code, read in from non-volatile storage when the program is launched.
  - The data section stores global and static variables, allocated and initialized prior to executing main.
  - The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation, and is managed via calls to new, delete, malloc, free, etc.
  - The stack is used for local variables. Space on the stack is reserved for local variables when they are declared ( at function entrance or elsewhere, depending on the language ), and the space is freed up when the variables go out of scope. Note that the stack is also used for function return values, and the exact mechanisms of stack management may be language specific.
  - Note that the stack and the heap start at opposite ends of the process's free space and grow towards each other. If they should ever meet, then either a stack overflow error will occur, or else a call to new or malloc will fail due to insufficient memory available.
- When processes are swapped out of memory and later restored, additional information must also be stored and restored. Key among them are the program counter and the value of all program registers.

## Process State

Processes may be in one of 5 states, as shown below.

- **New** - The process is in the stage of being created.
- **Ready** - The process has all the resources available that it needs to run, but the CPU is not currently working on this process's instructions.
- **Running** - The CPU is working on this process's instructions.
- **Waiting** - The process cannot run at the moment, because it is waiting for some resource to become available or for some event to occur. For example the process may be waiting for keyboard input, disk access request, inter-process messages, a timer to go off, or a child process to finish.
- **Terminated** - The process has completed.

## Process Control Block

For each process there is a PCB which stores the following process-specific information.

- **Process State** - as discussed above
- **Process ID** and parent process ID
- **CPU registers and Program Counter** - These need to be saved and restored when swapping processes in and out of the CPU
- **CPU-Scheduling information** - Such as priority information and pointers to scheduling queues
- **Memory-management information** - E.g. page tables or segment tables
- **Accounting information** - user and kernel CPU time consumer, account numbers, limits, etc.
- **I/O Status information** - Device allocated, open file tables.

## Threads

Modern systems allow a single process to have multiple threads of executions, which execute concurrently.

# Process Scheduling

The two main objectives of the process scheduling system are to keep the CPU busy at all times and to deliver "acceptable" response times for all programs, particularly for interactive ones.

## Scheduling Queues

- All processes are stored in the **job queue**
- Processes in the Ready state are placed in the **ready queue**
- Processes waiting for a device are placed in **device queues**
- There is a separate device queue for each device

## Schedulers

A **long-term scheduler** is mostly found in batch systems or heavily loaded systems. It runs infrequently and can afford to take the time to implement intelligent and advanced scheduling algorithms.

The **short-term scheduler**, or a CPU scheduler, runs very frequently, on the order of 100 milliseconds, and must very quickly swap one process out of the CPU and swap in another one.

Some systems employ a **medium-term scheduler**. When system loads get high, this scheduler will swap one or more processes out of the ready queue system for a few seconds, in order to allow smaller faster jobs to finish up quickly and clear the system.

An efficient scheduling system will select a good **process** mix of **CPU-bound** processes and **I/O bound** processes.

## Context Switch

Whenever an interrupt arrives, the CPU must do a **state-save** of the currently running process, then switch into kernel mode to handle the interrupt, and then do a **state-restore** of the interrupted process.

Similarly, a **context switch** occurs when the time slice for one process has expired and a new process is to be loaded from the ready queue. This will be started by a timer interrupts, which will then cause the current process' state to be saved and the new process' state to be restored.

Saving and restoring states involves saving and restoring all of the registers and program counter(s), as well ass the process control blocks described above.

Context switches happens _very_ frequently, and the overhead of doing the switching is lost CPU time, so context switches must be as fast as possible.

# Operations on Process

## Process Creation

- Processes may create other processes through appropriate system calls such as **fork** or **spawn**. The process which does the creating is called **parent** and the other is termed the **child**.
- Each process is given an integer identifier, termed its **process identifier** or PID. The parent PID is also stored for each process.
- On typical UNIX systems the process scheduler is termed **sched**, and is given `PID 0`. The first thing it does at system startup time is to launch **init**, which gives that process `PID 1`. Init then launches all system daemons (computer program that runs as a background process) and user logins, and becomes the ultimate parent of all other processes.
- A child process may receive some amount of shared resources from the parent. A limit of resources can be placed by the parent, so the children don't consume too many resources
- There are two options for the parent process after creating the child
  1. Wait for the child process to terminate. The parent makes a `wait()` system call, for either a specific child or any child that causes the parent process to block until the `wait()` returns. UNIX shells normally wait for their children to complete before issuing a new prompt.
  2. Run concurrently with the child. This is the operation seen when a UNIX shell runs a process as a background task It is also possible for the parent to run for a while, and then wait for the child later.
- Two possibilities for the address space of the child relative to the parent:
  1. The child may be an exact duplicate of the parent. Same program and data segments in memory. Each will have their own PCB, including program counter, registers and PID. This is known as the `fork()` system call in UNIX.
  2. The child process may have a new program loaded into its address space, with all new code and data segments. This is known as the `spawn()` system call in Windows. UNIX systems implement a second step using the `exec()` system call.

Here is an example of a `fork()`:

```C
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
pid_t pid;
  /* fork a child process */
  pid = fork();

  if (pid < 0) /* error occurred */ {
    fprintf (stderr, "Fork Failed");
    exit(-1);
  }
  else if (pid == 0) /* child process */ {
    execlp ("/bin/ls", "ls", NULL);
  }
  else {/* parent process */
  /* parent will wait for child to complete */
    wait(NULL);
    printf("Child Complete");
    exit(0);
  }
}
```

## Process Termination

- Processes may request their own termination by making the `exit()` system call, typically returning an int. This is passed to the parent if it is doing a `wait(), and is typically 0 on successful completion and some non-zero if there are problems.
  - child code:
    ```C
    int exitCode;
    exit ( exitCode ) // return the exitCode; has the same effect when executed from main()
    ```
  - parent code:
    ```C
    pid_t pid;
    int status
    pid = wait( &status );
    // pid indicates which child exited. exitCode in low-order bits of status
    // macros can test the high-order bits of status for why it stopped
    ```
- Process may also be terminated by the system for the following reasons:
  - the inability of the system to deliver necessary system resources
  - in response to a KILL command, or other un handled process interrupt
  - if the parent exits, the system may or may not allow the child to continue without a parent. (On UNIX, orphan processes are generally inherited by **init**, which proceeds to kill them. The UNIX `nohup` command allows a child to continue executing after its parent has exited.)
- when a process terminates, all of its processes are freed up. The process termination time and status are returned to the parent if the parent is waiting for the child to terminate, or eventually return to init if the process becomes an orphan. \*Processes that are trying to terminate, but which cannot because their parent is not waiting for them are termed **zombies\***. These are eventually inherited by init as orphans and killed.
