An **operating system** is a program that **manages the computer hardware**. It also **provides a basis for application programs** and **acts as an intermediary between computer user and the computer hardware**.

# What Operating Systems Do 

A computer system has four main components: *hardware*, *operating system*, application programs, and the users. The **operating system** provides the means for proper use of these resources in the operation of the computer system. 

## User View

In terms of a user, the operating system is designed mostly for **ease of use**, with some attention paid to performance and none paid to **resource utilization**.

## System View
From the computer's point of view, the operating system is the program most intimately involved with the hardware. In this context, the operating system can be viewed as a **resource allocator**.

A different view of an operating system emphasizes the need to control the various I/O devices and user programs. An operating system is a **control program** that manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer.

## Defining the Operating System

A common definition is that the **operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer-usually called the *kernel***
