# Role of the Operating System
- Bridging the hardware/user gap
    - Hide the complexity of directly dealing with hardware devices, e.g.
        - disk storage: file system
        - IO devices: monitor/keyboard/mouse
        - CPU: compilers, multiprogramming, etc 
    - Provide abstraction of hardware devices
        - Provide a simple API (interface) to users
        - Provide a unified interface â€“ for similar devices 
    - Provide virtualization of devices
        - Create virtual devices (services) using existing ones

### The OS as a resource manager
- basically refers to the OS being like a time manager where each program uses the processor at different times
- multiprogramming and multitasking (Time-sharing)
- multiprogramming increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs (code and data) so that the CPU always has one to execute
- time-sharing the CPU executes multiple jobs by switching among them, but the switches occur so frequently that the users can interact with each program while it is running.

# Dual-Mode operation
- a user mode or a non-privileged mode
- a kernel mode or a priveleged mode

The **kernel** of an OS is the minimal set of functions necessary to manage the system resources safely and efficiently.

This identification is handled by a mode bit, and it lets the system determine what programs are crucial and need to be run without violating the integrity of the system.
