# Basic Hardware

It should be noted that from the memory chips point of view, all memory accesses are equivalent. The memory hardware doesn't know what a particular part of memory is being used for, nor does it care. This is almost true of the OS as well, although not entirely.

The CPU can only access its registers and main memory. It cannot, for example, make direct access to the hard drive, so any data stored there must first be transferred into the main memory chips before the CPU can work with it. 

Memory accesses to registers are very fast, generally one clock tick, and a CPU may be able to execute more than one machine instruction per clock tick.

Memory accesses to main memory are comparatively slow, and may take a number of clock ticks to complete. This would require intolerable waiting by the CPU if it were not for an intermediary fast memory cache built into most modern CPUs. The basic idea of the cache is to transfer chunks of memory at a time from the main memory to the cache, and then to access individual memory locations one at a time from the cache.

User processes must be restricted so that they only access memory locations that "belong" to that particular process. This is usually implemented using a base register and a limit register for each process.

Every memory access made by a user process is checked against these two registers, and if a memory access is attempted outside the valid range, then a fatal error is generated. The OS obviously has access to all existing memory locations, as this is necessary to swap users' code and data in and out of memory. It should also be obvious that changing the contents of the base and limit registers is a privileged activity, allowed only to the OS kernel.
