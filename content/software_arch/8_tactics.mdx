# Goal of Design

Derive a solution for requirements
- Functionality
- Constraints
- Qualities

# Qualiy Attributes

- Availiablity
- Modifiability
- Security
- Utilisability
- Interoperability
- Performance
- Testability

## Availiablity

Software there and ready to carry out its task when its needed
- Fault --> Failure
- Reliability: Mean Time between Failures
- Recovery: Mean Time to Repair

Scenario:
- Source: Heartbeat monitor
- Stimulus: Server unresponsive
- Artifact: Process, Environment: Normal Operation
- Response: Inform operator continue to operate
- Response Measure: No downtime

### Tactics for Availability

- prevent/mitigate failures from faults
- fault --> tactics to control availability

#### Detect Faults
- Monitor
    - monitors components state of health
- Ping/echo
    - Asynchronous request/response message exchange
- Heartbeat
    - periodic notification
- Timestamp
- Condition Monitoring
- Exception Detection
- Sanity Checking
- Voting
- Self-test

#### Recover from Faults
- Redundancy
    - Active Redundancy (Hot Spare)
        - all components receive and process identical inputs in parallel
    - Passive Redundancy (Warm Spare)
        - only active member process the input
        - the active member provides spares with periodic state updates
    - Spare (Cold Spare)
        - switches to spare when active member fails 
        - power-on-reset procedure
- Preparation & Repair
    - Exception Handling
    - Software Upgrade
    - Ignore Faulty Behavior
    - Reconfiguration
    - Rollback
    - Retry
    - Degradation
- Reintroduction
    - Shadow
    - State Resunchronization
    - Escalating Restart
    - Non-stop Forwarding

#### Prevent Faults

- Removal from service
- Predictive Model
- Transactions
- Exception Prevention
- Increase competence set

## Interoperability

Degree to which parties can usefully exchange meaningful information
- Locate each other
- Understand each other

Scenario:
- Source of Stimulus: Our vehicle information system
- Stimulus: Current location sent
- Artifact: Traffic monitoring system, Environment: systems known prior to run-time
- Response: Traffic monitor, combines current location with other information, overlays on google maps and broadcasts
- Response Measure: Our information included correctly 99.9% of the time

### Tactics for Interoperability

- Allow correct handling of Information exchange
    - Information Exchange Request --> Tactics to control Interoperability --> request correctly handled

- Adapter Pattern
    - provides expected interface

## Modifiability

- cost and risk of making changes
    - what can change
    - likelihood of the change
    - when change is made
    - who makes it

Scenario:
- Source: developer
- Stimulus: wishs to change the UI
- Artifact: Code, Environment: Design time
- Response: Change Made and Unit Tested
- Response Measure: in 3 hours

### Modifiability Tactics

- control complexity (time, cost) of changes
- change arrives --> tactics to control Modifiability --> change made within Time and Budget

- Reduce Coupling
    - Encapsulate
        - Introduces interface: hides internals (e.g. Facade)
    - Intermediary
        - Breaks dependency
    - Restrict Dependencies
        - constraints interactions (e.g. Layering)
    - Refactor
    - Abstract Common Services
- Defer Binding
    - Later binding better modifiability
        - compile/build time, build script or aspects
        - deployment time, configuration-time binding
        - startup/initailization time, resource files
        - run-time, dependecny injection, dynmamic lookup of services, message brokers, plug-ins.

## Performance

Ability to meet timing requirements
- time to respond to events
- which events occurs
- time-based response

Scenario:
- Source: Users
- Stimulus: Initate Transactions,
- Artifact: System, Environment: Normal Operation
- Responses: transactions are processed
- Response Measure: average latency of two seconds

### Performance Tactics

- Generate a response to an event arriving at the system within some time-based constraint
- Event arrives --> tactis to control performance --> response generated within time constraints

![Image](https://bohutskyi.com/images/performace_tactics.png)

- Control Resource Demand
    - Manage sampling rate
    - Limit Event response
    - Prioritize events
    - Reduce Overhead
    - Bound Execution times
    - increase resource efficiency
- Manage resources
    - increase resources
    - maintain multiple copies of computations
    - bound queue sizes
    - increase concurrency
    - maintain multiple copies of Data
    - schedule resources

## Security
- ability to protect data and information from attacks
    - unauthorized access to data/services
    - denial of access
- characteristcs
    - confidentiality
    - integrity
    - availability
    - authentication
    - non-repudiation 
    - authorization

Scenario:
- source: disgruntled employee from remote location
- Stimulus: attempts to modify pay rate
- Artifact: data within the system, Environment: Normal operations
- Response: System maintains audit trail
- Response Measure: correct data is restored within a day and source of tampering and identified

### Security Tactics

## Testability

- Ease to have software demonstrate its faults
    - ability to reveal faults
    - control inputs/state
    - observe inputs/state
    - complexity

Scenario:
- source: unit tester
- stimulus: code unit completed
- artifact: code unit, Environment: development
- response: results captured
- response measure: 85% path coverage in thress hours

### Testability Tactics

## Usability

Degree to which users easily, effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily perform their tasks
- learning system features
- using a system efficiently
- minimizing the impact of erros
- adapting the system to user needs
- increasing confidence and satisfaction

Scenario:
- source: user
- stimulus: donwloads a new application
- artifact: system, environment: runtime
- response: user uses application productivity
- response measure: within two minutes of experimentation
