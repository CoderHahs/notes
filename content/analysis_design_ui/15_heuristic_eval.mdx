# Heuristic Evaluation

Purpose:
- Find usability problems in a design

How:
- provide a set of usability principles (heuristics)
- a small group of evaluators (3-5) review the UI
    - independently verify compliance with heuristics

When:
- can be done on a fully developed user interface or paper sketches.


# 10 Usability heuristics
- Visibility 
- Mapping
- Freedom
- Consistency
- Error prevention
- Recognition
- Flexibility
- Minimalism
- Error Recovery
- Help

# Methodology

Evaluation Steps:
1. Pre-Assessment Training
    - If the system is for everyone ("walk-up-and-use") or the evaluators are experts in the domain, no assistance is required.
    - Otherwise, the evaluators should be provided with scenarios and a minimum of information about the domain (organization of knowledge) and anticipated processes.
2. Assessment
    - at least two passes for each evaluator
        - first to get an idea of the scope of the system
        - second to focus on specific items
    - each evaluator produces a list of issues
        - explain why by referring to the heuristics
        - be specific and list each problem separately
        - indicate where the problem is
            - unique location in the user interface
            - two or more places in the UI to compare
            - overall structure of the UI
            - something is missing
3. Prioritization
    - severity combines:
        - frequency (one or more places)
        - impact (aesthetic or functional)
        - persistence of the problem
4. Debriefing
    - meeting between the evaluators and the design team
    - discussion about:
        - list of problems found
        - severity perceived by each of the evaluators
        - possibility of improvements
        - estimation of resource allocation to solve problems
