# Six Goals

These goals are for the improvement of the user's productivity. We'll look at all these goals with a Food Ordering System.


### Proper Functionality

The systems functions as expected.

Example: When ordering, we can only add meny items, but we can't remove them. This is ```bad``` functionality.

### Consistency

A UI element has the same behaviour everywhere it is used (helps build mental models).

Example: Everytime I click on a menu item, I see additional information about the item. This is ```good``` consistency.

### Efficency

A good UI will assist users to complete task in timely manner and eliminate unneccessary steps.

Example: Everytime I add something to my order, it takes me to the shopping cart. I have to press "back to menu" to continue. This is a lot of steps that could be avoided. This is ```bad``` efficiency.

### Usability

System is easy to learn and intuitive.

Example: From the menu page, cannot access the shopping cart without adding an item to get there. This is ```bad``` usability.

### Reliability

System functions without major flaws. Does what it should be doing.

Example: The calculated total amount due is wrong. This is ```bad``` reliability.

### Security and Data Integrity

System protects users data from tampering and alteration. Harder to determine, since this could be more of a backend task.

Example: The ordering system seems to use an encrypted approach to manage my credit card information. This is ```good``` security and shows data integrity.
