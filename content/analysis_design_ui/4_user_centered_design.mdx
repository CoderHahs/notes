**User-Centered Design** is making user interfaces that:
- focus on user needs
- allow users to efficiently accomplish their tasks
- in other words, user productivity

The motivation of this is to develop a design framework allowing interaction designers to build more realistic systems that are easier to use and that better meet the needs of users.

# Principles:
- **Focus on users**:
    - Study cognitive, behavioral and attitudinal characteristics
- **Focus on tasks**:
    - Define and understand user tasks
- **Iterative design**:
    - Design, prototype, evaluate, redesign

- Admit to oursleves that we will not get it right on the first try
- Make early iterations as cheap as possible
    - paper prototyping
- Results of the evaluation will inform our design (rather than preconceived opinions)
- Must ensure that designers do not get emotionally attached to a design

## When do we stop?

- When the obtained results are satisfying
- When the usability goals have been achieved
- Until you run out of money...

*Learning some design guidelines should help reduce the number of iterations...*
