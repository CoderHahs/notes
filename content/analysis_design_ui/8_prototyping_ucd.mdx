# Prototyping at the heart of UCD
- Philosophy: Admit to ourselves that everything will not be perfect the first time
- Make the first iterations as cheap as possibile
    - paper prototyping 

# Personas on stage
- A scenario is a story about a user using the system
    - inspired directly from task analysis
    - must be concrete, realistic but fictional
- Sets up a situation involving a user with a goal to achieve
    - follows the user through the tasks and subtasks to satisfy the goal
- Using the persona to simulate the goals/tasks is ideal

# Personas are all different
Generate alternatives: 
- Generating alternative is not necessarily easy. It requires creativity and research. Humans tend to stick to what they know.

- Considering alternatives is important to "break out of the box"

- How to generate alternatives:
    - Flair and creativity: research and synthesis
    - Seek inspiration: look at similar or very different products for good ideas to adopt or bad ideas to reject
