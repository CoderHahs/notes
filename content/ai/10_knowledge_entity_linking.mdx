# Knowledge Organization

Our brain tries to connect words together based on their relationships.

## Taxonomy

This connects words based on specificity. For example vegetable can be linked to greens which can be linked to spinach.

## Meronymy

This connects words based on a predefined relationship.

For example:

| Type                | Example          |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Component – Object  | Head – Body      |
| Material – Object   | Wood             |
| Membre - Collection | Tree - Forest    |
| Location – Area     | Ottawa - Ontario |
| Phase – Process     | Youth - life     |

## Semantic Network

This connects words based a "one to two word" description.

For example:
- Cat *has* fur
- Cat *is a* mammal
- Fish *lives in* water

# Semantics

## Definitional

Words can also be connected based on definitions. They can have both taxonomic and meronymic parts.

## Predicates / Attributes

A large knowledge base created from the “infobox” sections of wikipedia. Has become the largest knowledge base in the Semantic Web. The structure is in triple form: predicate(subject, object).

## Distributional

> you know a word by the company it keeps

Trying to figure out a word based on the words around it. 

For example:
- I did X today
    - X is probably an activity
- I ate X today
    - X is some sort of food

Overtime and several examples, the distributional semantics get better since the examples work as weights in a neural net.

# Semantic Similarity

## Definitional Semantic

1. Explicit synonymy
2. Similarity of definitions (comparing the text)
3. Proximity in Taxonomy
    - hypernym: dog/animal
    - co-hyponyms: dog/cat (both having animal as a hypernym)

## Predicate Semantic

1. shared predicates between concepts/entities

## Distributional

1. vector similarity (cosine)
2. 2d map

# Entity Linking

## Ambiguity in named entity recognition

- confusion with general language:
    - I have an account at *Tangerine*
    - I ate a *tangerine* for breakfast
- confusion between types:
    - I visited *Paris* last year.
    - *Paris* Hilton is in the news today.

## Ambiguity within a type

- confusion within the same type - entity Linking
    - my friend learned French before going to *Paris*
        - confusion with Paris and Paris, Texas
    - *Michael Jordon* was invited speaker at the ML conference.
        - confusion with basketball player and ML researcher

## Algorithms

Use Bag of words match algorithm to find similarities with corpus for ambiguous words.

```
build a bag-of-words BOW_c to contain the words in the context of occurrence of the occurrence of the ambiguous word:
for each possible sense s=1 .. S do:
    Build a bag-of-words BOW_s, to contain the words in the definition of sense s
Assign MaxOverlap to 0
Assign BestSense to null
for each possible sense s=1..S do:
    Measure overlap = Overlap (BOW_c, BOW_s)
    if overlap > MaxOverlap:
        MaxOverlap = overlap
        BestSense = s
```

**Collective Disambiguation** referring to the corpus and linking words to entities
