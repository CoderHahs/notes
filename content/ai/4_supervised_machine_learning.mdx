# Components of a Supervised Machine Learning System

Steps of Learning:
- Training data
- Features vector
- Algorithm
- Model

Inference from Model:
- Test data
- Features vector
- Model
- Prediction

# Features

There are two types of features: Continuous and Discrete. 

**One-hot encoding** to convert discrete into Continuous, where there are as many dimensions(features) as the number of values.

**Discretization** to convert continuous into discrete, where features are divided into buckets.

# Generative and Discriminative Learners

## Discriminative Learners

The objective of this learning algorithm is to learn a decision surface in an N-dimensional space (N - number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points (examples).

We call the decision surface, the **discriminative function**. The whole point of learning is to be able to correctly classify unseen examples.

A discriminative learner is essentially an equation (decision surface) that acts as a classification/boundary. 

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

It maximizes the margin between the support vectors. Depends on the features that are the closest.

### Decision Trees

Will create as many boundaries as necessary to separate the training data. It creates zone by splitting on each feature.

### Multi-Layer Perceptron

Will be able to learn decision surfaces that are not planes. These are higher degree polynomial separators.

## Probabilistic Approach

The learner assumes the data comes from more or less probable classes.

It is important that the construction of the training set reflects the generative process and reduces bias.

# Evaluation

## Factors to Consider

### What do we evaluate on?

We always evaluate on unseen data, or "test" data. **Cross validation** is a technique for evaluating ML models by training on subsets of the available input data and evaluating them on the complementary subset of the data.

### Is the training data representative of the test data?

Training data should be similar to the test data.

### What is the Performance Measure

**Confusion Matrix** measures precision (true positive / true positive + false positive) and recall (true positive / true positive + false negative)

**Macro-average** is the average on the results per class. **Micro-average** is the average when putting all the data together.

### Is the gold standard unanimously agreed on?

Do all humans think the same, is your classification of the training data correct?
