# What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence refers to the ability of a computer or a computer-enabled robotic system to process information and produce outcomes in a manner similar to the though process of humans in learning, decision making and solving problems. By extension, the goal of AI systems is to develop systems capable of tackling complex problems in ways similar to human logic and reasoning. 

John McCarthy is the Father of AI.
