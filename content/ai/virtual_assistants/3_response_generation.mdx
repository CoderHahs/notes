Response generation is how virtual assistants construct a response based on the request given.

A response in relation to action performed can look like this:

# VA or Chatbot

## Virtual Assistants

This is software that can assist people with basic tasks, usually using natural language. Intelligent personal assistants can go online and search for an answer to a user's question. Either text or voice can trigger an action.

## Chatbots

Text is the main way to get assistance from a chatbot.
Chatbots can simulate a conversation with a human user. Many
companies use them in the customer service sector to answer basic
questions and connect with a live person if necessary

# Conversational Design

8 principles:

- cooperative
  - Paul Grice believed that there's no conversation without
    cooperation. It means your chatbot can support a customer
    only if it cooperates and provides information the user is
    looking for.
- goal-oriented

- context-aware
  - Create personalized chatbot greetings. They'll pop up in
    various conditions, based on the time a user spends on a
    page, a page address, or a referring source.
  - You can create a different greeting for users who visit your
    website for the first time and for those who are recurring
    visitors.
  - Personalization boosts engagement and improves user
    experience.
- quick and clear
  - While creating your chatbot stories, try to avoid complex
    metaphors, idioms, and long ambiguous statements. They
    slow down the conversation and take users away from
    where they need to be.
  - Use simple language, don't ask a user to choose many things
    at once, and get to the point
- turn-based
- truthful
- polite
- error tolerant
  - To make your chatbot error-tolerant, try to anticipate
    common spelling mistakes first. Teach your chatbot these
    variations to improve its understanding
