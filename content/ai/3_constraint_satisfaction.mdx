A **Constraint Satisfaction Problem** is a characterized by:
- A set of variables $V_1, V_2, ..., V_n$
- Each variable $V_i$ has an associated domain $\D_{V_i}$ of possible values.
- There are hard constraints on various subsets of the variables which specify legal combinations of values for these variables.
- A solution to the CSP is an assignment of a value to each variable that satisfies all the constraints.

## Hard and Soft constraints

- Given a set of variables, assign a value to each variable that either
    - satisfies some set of constraints: **satisfiability problems** = "hard constraints"
    - minimizes some cost function, where each assignment of values to variables has some cost: **optimization problems** = "soft constraints"
- Many problems are a mix of hard and soft constraints (called constrained optimization problems).

Examples of Satisfiability:
- scheduling without preferences
- scheduling with preferences
- knapsack problem

Example of Optimization:
- scheduling with preferences
- knapsack
- TSP

# Satisfiability

## Generate-and-Test algorithm

- Generate all possibilities and test all (brute force)
- Generate the assignment space $D = D_{V_1} \cdot D_{V_2} \cdot ... \cdot D_{V_n}$
- Test cases become to big is a downside

## Arc consistency algorithms

- Idea: prune the domains as much as possible before selecting values from them.
- A variable is **domain consistent** if no value of the domain of the node is ruled impossible by any of the constraints.

### Constraint Graph
![Image](https://artint.info/figures/ch04/ConstraintNetwork1.gif)

- oval shape for nodes representing variables
- rectangular shape for constraints
- there is a domain associated with each variable node
- there is an arc starting at the variable X for each constraint that involves it

# AC-3 Algorithm

AC stands for arc consistency. 

- Put all arcs in a Queue. 
- Evaluate each arc to see if it is consistent.

G is a constraint network representing a CSP with V, D, C

## Algorithm

```
Q = {(Vi, Vj) such that (Vi, Vj) is part of edges (G), i != j}
While Q not empty:
    Choose and remove (Vk, Vm) from Q
    If revise((Vk, Vm)) then:
        Q = Q union {(Vi, Vk) for all edges (G), i!= k, i!=m}
    End While
End Ac-3
```

Three possible results:
- At least one domain is empty -> no solution
- each domain is reduced to a single value -> unique solution
- certain domains have more than one value -> maybe none, maybe one, maybe multiple solutions, continue and explore

# Greedy Search

- Greedy Search for planning
    - alphabetical order, small non-conflicting value
    - most constrained to least constrained domain
- Greedy search for knapsack
    - choose the highest value first. For two equal values, choose the least heavy
    - choose heaviest first. If two equal weights, choose hightest value
- Greedy search for TSP
    - go to closest city, if 2 equal choices, select in descending alphabetical order

## Search Space

**Local maximum (or minimum)**: There exists a better solution that cannot be reached by making local moves according to the cost function.

**Global maximum (or minimum)**: Where the optimal solution is found. Where the cost function is minimized or maximized.

**Plateau**: An area of the search space which provides no clue as to where to go since all neighbors seem locally equal in their evaluation of the cost function.
