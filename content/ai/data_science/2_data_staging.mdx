# Planning

GoaL of data staging is the get the right data from sources to a data mart.

## Best way to do data staging?

1. Round up the requirements - conceptual model
2. Consider the business needs
3. Study the sources
4. Look out for data limitations
5. Decide on scripting languages
6. Look at the staff skills
7. Remember legacy licenses

## The data staging steps

A: Planning

1. High level Planning
2. Detailed planning: dimension management, error handling, fact table construction, etc.

B: Develop one-time historic load
C: Develop incremental Load

### Step A1: High-level Planning

Create a very high-level, one-page schematic of the source-to-target flow

- Identify starting and ending points
- Label known data sources
- Include placeholders for sources yet to be determined
- Label targets
- Add notes about known problems

### Step A2: Detailed planning by table

- Drill down by target table, graphically sketching any complex data restructuring or transformations
- Identify attribute hierarchies (normalize the source)

  - A hierarchy is a relationship between attributes where
    the data rolls up into higher levels of summarization in
    a series of strict many-to-one relationships. Hierarchies
    are reflected by additional columns in a dimensional
    table.
  - The inverse of a roll up is a drill down
  - Data staging issue, make sure hierarchies are clean (e.g., products in a store)

- Graphically illustrate the surrogate-key generation process
- Develop a preliminary job sequencing

# Initial and incremental loads

## Developing One-Time Historic Load

1. Build
