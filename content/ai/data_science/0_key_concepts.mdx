## Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)

Operations/Transactions:

- INSERT
- DELETE
- UPDATE
- QUERY

DBMS:

- Concurrency control
- Recovery
- Security

## Online Analytic Processing (OLAP)

- Data uploaded periodically
- Queries consist of aggregates (_SUM, COUNT, MIN, etc_) and are used for trends and icebergs

## Data Cubes

A data warehouse is based on a multidimensional data model which views data in the form of a **data cube**.

# Data Warehouse

A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and nonvolatile collection of data. Data warehousing is the process of constructing and using data warehouses.

## Benefits of a separate data warehouse

- High performance for both systems
  - DBMS is best for OLTP, access methods, indexing, concurrency control and recovery
  - Warehouse is best for OLAP: complex OLAP queries, multidimensional view, consolidation
- supports historical data (no missing data)
- data consolidation
- data quality, different sources typically use inconsistent data representations, codes and formats which have to be reconciled
