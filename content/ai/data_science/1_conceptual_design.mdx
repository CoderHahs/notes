Steps to create a Data Mart

# Dimensional Model

## Components

- **FACT table**: Primary table where numeric performance measures for a business process are stored
  - Composite PK from many FKs
  - Facts/measures: A business measure (numeric, additive)
- **Dimensional tables**
  - contains textual description of business
  - many, many, many dimensional attributes
  - used to specify query constraints

# Designing an Individual Dimensional Model

## Step 1: Choose the Business Process to Model

- Almost always something to do with the "Sales" and/or "Productivity"
  - Retail
  - Healthcare
  - Insurance
  - Telecoms
- Motivated using \$\$\$\$ saved (or gained)

## Step 2: Declare the Gain

- Answer question: _"How do you describe a single row in the fact table"_
- General guiding principle:
  - we choose the _lowest meaningful (and feasible) grain_ of each dimension
- Why:
  - we want to see all those details
  - we can always aggregate (sum, count, average) later

## Step 3: Choose the Dimensions

- Answer question: "How does the business describe the data that results from the business process?"
- This is determined by grain of fact table
- add all possibly relevant dimensions and many, many descriptive attribute values

## Step 4: Choose the Facts/Measures

- Answer question: "What are we measuring?"
- Specific to grain of fact table
- Store additive values
- Percentages and ratios, also store numerator + denominator
